Sparkling Virat Kohli hundred sees India past Bangladesh in raucous Pune,19 Oct 2023 • 10:10 pm,"Virat Kohli smashed a century as India maintained their perfect record in the World Cup, cruising to a fourth consecutive victory in the tournament with a clinical seven-wicket win over Bangladesh. Bangladesh had to conjure up something extraordinary to upset an India team, who went into the match with a hat-trick of wins, and the task became even harder in the absence of skipper Shakib Al Hasan, who sat out with a left quad injury. Electing to bat, Bangladesh could not capitalise on the 93-run opening stand from Litton Das and Tanzid Hasan and made 256-8 on a batting deck at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. It was a clinical bowling effort by India, considering they were one bowler short from early in the match after Hardik Pandya twisted his ankle in his first over. Skipper Rohit Sharma led India’s rapid reply and Virat Kohli ended with an unbeaten 103, hitting a six to reach his hundred and secure India’s win with 51 balls to spare. Reuters Player of the match, India’s Virat Kohli: “I wanted to make a big contribution. “I’ve had a few fifties in World Cups and haven’t converted them so I just wanted to finish the game off this time around and hang around to the end, which is what I’ve done over the years for the team. “It was a dream start for me with two free hits. It just calms you done and lets you get into the innings. “The pitch was pretty good, it allowed me to play my game and just hit the gaps. “There is a great atmosphere in the changing room, we’re loving each other’s company, the spirit is there for everyone to see on the field. “We understand it’s a long tournament and you need to create some momentum for the guys to come out and play like this. “It’s a special feeling playing at home in front of all these people and we just want to make the most of it.” The crowd has truly gone mad in Pune. ‘KOHLI, KOHLI, KOHLI’ is the chant that rings out around the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. Barely a soul has left.  In all the mayhem it would be easy to forget that this was far from a close game of cricket. India swatted aside Bangladesh with a near-perfect performance, soured only slightly by the injury to Hardik Pandya. 100 FOR VIRAT KOHLI! It comes in suitable style as well, thumping a six over mid-wicket. For a non-competitive game, that was some finish.  There are no singles being taken now. This is all about getting Kohli to three figures now. Hasan goes short and high over the head of Kohli. It’s a wide! Boos ring out around the ground. Kohli will have to hit a boundary to get there now.  Brilliant running from the pair. Kohli drops it barely two wickets away from the pitch and they scamper back for a couple. Two balls later it’s the same again; brilliant running brings another two. India need three, Kohli needs four. Four more for Kohli. He’s on 85 and India need 15. He couldn’t could he? He certainly could! Six more over mid-wicket. Pune is coming alive here, all they want is another nine runs for Kohli. He takes a single off the last ball of the over and retains the strike. Kohli goes short-arm, pulling Hasan hard off a ball that should be far too full for a shot like that. It’s excellent fielding at mid-wicket otherwise that would have been a certain boundary. Kohli wants this done methinks. He picks the slower ball and smashes Hasan back over his head for six. An incredible shot on replay. Great hands and so much wrist from Kohli. Another pad smack from Kohli as he nails one along the ground for a single off Mehidi. Honestly Virat, not a lot wrong with that shot as far as I can tell. Six balls, six singles...again.   Kohli continues to chastise himself for missing out on what he sees are easy boundary opportunities. This time it’s a drive off a full-pitched delivery from Shoriful that draws his ire.  What shot from Rahul. Shoriful proficiency with the short ball appears to have deserted him as Rahul helps himself to a flat six and another boundary off the very next ball. Mehidi just pushes one through a touch and Kohli is lucky to have his inside edge rescue him from a near-certain wicket. Rahul and Kohli both pick up singles as India continue their charge towards this total. Shoriful is back. He’s bowled well this evening with very little to work with on this surface however that is poor. It’s short, too short, and simply not quick enough to trouble Rahul, who only has to lift it off his hip to beat the man at deep square-leg.  Nasser Hussain makes a good point on Sky comms. On pitches like this, you need to have some kind of mystery spin in your attack to really threaten the top batting line-ups. With little-to-no turn, these finger spinners just aren’t asking any questions of these batsmen.  A Kohli single pushes India up to 200. Mahmudullah gets his first bowl of the evening and is immediately shouting ‘catch’ as Rahoul pulls uppishly into the leg side out towards the man at deep mid-wicket. Not a chance though as that drops well short.  Six singles from six balls. Kohli has donned his cap to face Mehidi. Too hot? Too comfortable? Likely a combination of both. There’s a brief moment of concern as Rahul’s drive is well fielded, leading to the merest hint of a runout chance. Kohli gets home safely. This surface is so good. Kohli has so much faith against the spinners that he’s able to move into unorthodox positions to keep the scoreboard ticking. You simply can’t build pressure without dots and dots on a pitch like this are very tough to come by. Here comes KL Rahul. Things don’t get any easier with this Indian batting line-up. He gets off the mark with a beautiful cut shot, giving himself plenty of room by backing away beyond leg stump and trusting his hands and eye to make contact.  Iyer c Mahmudullah b Mehidy 19 As we were saying, Bangladesh need rash shots off these spinners and they get one there. Like Gill, Iyer has eyes only for the stands but is way too early on that one, sending it high into the Pune sky. ANother good catch in the deep from Mahmudullah. Mustafizur returns to the attack. Kohli curses himself after he smashes a half-volley right at mid-off. He wanted a boundary there and this crowd did too. The Fiz, as Rob aptly named him, is persisting with the short stuff. Smart, but even that looks like it’s becoming easy to deal with.  The final ball of the over is a good one. Sliding across the right-hander on a good length and somehow Kohli has the skill to lean on it and crush the ball through cover for four. Nasum is another spinner who simply can’t build any pressure here. It’s a fairly good over but such is the Indian confidence that they are able to milk it for singles. Iyer gets fortunate. He wants to take Hasan into the stands but judges it slightly wrong and is lucky when an inside edge crashes off his back pad rather than the stumps.  Kohli continues his imperious progress. This time he gets the pull exactly right, getting on top of the bounce and turns it out to mid-wickets for four. A single off the final ball of the over brings up Kohli’s fifty. Tweaks and touches from India. Deft footwork is allowing them to rotate strike with ease, working Mehidy into gaps in his field. The end of each over sees the onsight DJ dropping a different song. I myself can;’t name them but judging by the crowd reaction these all must be very, very popular. Iyer goes for a quick single off Hasan. He gets home but comes up limping after an attempted run-out throw hits him on the inside on the ankle. Looks a sore one but he should be fine to continue. Kohli this time is early on the pull. If there’s one shot where looks a little vulnerable right now it’s that one. Iyer though has no such problems with the same shot, crushing Hasan through mid-wickets as the bowler drops just a touch short. The bleeding continues. Singles all over the field off Mehid. Kohli has the time to back away from one fired at his beds and thump it down the ground for one.  You know batters are comfortable when it becomes apparent they can hit any ball, almost anywhere they want. You know when Kohli is feeling it. There’s proper pop off his bat at the moment, even on non-scoring shots.  Iyer shuffles across to Shoriful and tucks him off his hips for a single down to fine leg. Far too easy for India right now. 3.96 is the current required rate. Wickets. Needed. Now. This is the sort of pitch which will require bad decisions from the Indian batters if wickets are to fall in bunches. There’s no spin at all for Mehidy.  Kohli punches Shoriful down the ground. It’s crisp and well-times but straight at the man at mid-off. The throw is unleashed and Kohli may well have been in trouble with a direct hit. Alas there is not and he survives.  Mushfiqur Rahim looks interested in a catch down the leg side. Did it come of Iyer’s glove? Doesn’t look it to me. They don’t review; good decision from Shanto. Shreyas Iyer is the next man in. He’s off the mark quickly with a single before Mehidy serves up a juicy half-volley to Kohli, who doesn’t miss out. His drive splits cover and point perfectly and races away to the boundary.  Iyer then gets his first boundary in decidedly less convincing fashion as his attempted cut races away fine off a thin outside edge. Gill c Mahmudullah b Mehidy 53 You could sense Gill was getting itchy and so it’s proved. He wants to take Mehidy into the baying Indian fans in the stands beyond the mid-wicket boundary but doesn’t get enough of it.  Mahmudullah is in the deep waiting. The catch is easy but he does very well to keep his feet away from the boundary rope. Shubman Gill brings up a leisurely fifty with a quick nudge into the leg side off Shoriful. For one so young he’s already morphed into a remarkable cricketer. He’s barely broken a sweat in this knock so far.  Kohli dabs cleverly with a horizontal bat down to the third man. Death by a thousand cuts here for Bangladesh at present. Mehidy comes into the attack. Bangladesh desperately need something here. Another ten over like this and this game will be well and truly gone. The packed house in Pune is oddly muted.   Gill and Kohli look ver comfortable against the left-arm spin of Nasum. Easy singles everywhere for India. They are so far ahead of this game they they need not take any unecessary risks.    Afternoon all and what time to enter this match with Kohli seemingly kicking up a gear.  Just as I say that the great man mis-times a pull, spooning the ball into a vacant gap at short mid-wicket. They scamper through for a single but dare I say Kohli will be thanking his lucky stars there. Gill punches powerfully off the back foot through cover, picking up a couple. Apologies. Our website seems to have been down for almost an hour so these updates when it’s eventually fixed will be skimmed at best. Typing into the void. What an epitaph that would be.  Nasum returns and Kohli whisks the left-arm spinner through midwicket where Shoriful dives over the ball and lets it through for four. Kohli, like KP, has been troubled by left-arm spin in the past but not here.  Nelson! Tom Ward will cover the rest of the match.  The Fiz continues and Kohli takes him for a single to cover, Gill rolls his wrists on a pull for another and then Virat gleans another down to third man from a jarring short one.  The problem after dismissing Rohit? Kohli. Two no-balls to the No3 don’t help, Kohli stabbing out the yorker for two off the first overstep and then spearing the free hit for four before the siren goes again, giving him a free hit off a free hit. Mahmud, now tentative about his feet, sticks one in the slot and Kohli hangs back to get under the ball and dumps it over long on for six. Twenty-three and a wicket off the over.  Rohit c Hridoy b Mahmud 48  The bowler held his nerve after Rohit pulled the preceding delivery for six, banged it in again on a tighter line and celebrated like a dervish when he toes his pull to deep backward square.  FOW 88/1    Mustafizur comes back after an earlier, expensive, one-over spell. Gill slashes a short one wide of third man for four then lives up to his “Smoothman Gill” sobriquet with a Ranji-esque leg-glance that races to the boundary and a glorious cover drive for a third four of the over.  In 22 ODIs in 2023 (yes, England, some teams were taking their preparation seriously) Shubman has made 1286 runs at 71 with one double hundred, four plain hundreds and five fifties.  Hasan Mahmud has wheels and is applauded by his bowling coach Allan Donald when he bounces Rohit, aiming for his neck and forcing the happy hooker to abort the stroke. But the next ball doesn’t get up as much and is a touch wider and Rohit helicopters through a pull, cracking it for four between the two fielders placed at deep backward square and square leg for that shot.  Shubman continues his annus mirabilis with a couple of mighty, lofted drives after skipping down for a pair of sixes. The second was mis-hit but clumped with such force that it sailed beyond long-off as ran to his left on the rope.  Cramping also works for Hasun against Rohit who takes three balls to get off strike with a single to square leg off a thickish inside edge. Gill, too, defends a couple then flicks a single into the legside. Turbo nurdling.  These overs are following a pattern at the moment. Takes an early boundary and then the bowler restores some element of control. Rohit sweeps hard, cuffing it in front of square for four. But that’s the only damage apart from a single at the end of the over.  Hasan Mahmud, right arm fast medium, replaces Shoriful and he, too, is taken for a boundary off his first over but this one is very jammy indeed, Gill striding down to slice it over the slips off a thick edge for four. He takes two more with a cramped pull and that approach, refusing to give Shubman any room to free his arms, works, earning him three dot balls.   Nasum uses skid and a lower trajectory to rack up five dot balls to Rohit but only after he began with a drag down that Rohit slapped on the cut for four.  One would say Rohit is in the form of his life but he has been as good and devastating as this for great swathes of his career. Decent, respectable length ball from Shoriful and Rohit brings his hands down from that great height, pivots his left elbow high and creams it over mid-off for four.  Shanto turns quickly to left-arm spin early after such a mauling. And Nasum does pin Gill from round the wicket, going up for a bellowed appeal but it was always angling down. Gill works a single through midwicket, Rohit flicks another round the corner but a glimmer for Bangladesh at the end when Gill is hurried by the skid as he tries to cut off his stumps and almost chops on.  If the ball’s there Rohit is going to flash his hands at it and width is all the invitation he needs. Standing stock still he transfers his weight back and then into the punch, flaying it for four in front of point. Shoriful tightens it up for a couple of balls and then drops short and Rohit, as good a puller as there has ever been, spanks it in front of square leg for a towering six, 10 rows back. Talk about peaking when it counts. India are on song with bat and ball. Who can stope them?  Gorgeous on drive from Shubman Gill for four when The Fiz swings one gently into middle and leg. He works another straight one through midwicket for a single and Rohit pushes a single down to mid-off. Mustafizur clawsit back with three dot balls to Gill but the damage had already been done.   No he won’t. Rohit pulls rank. Shoriful, a left-arm quick, swings his first ball into Rohit who defends it but when he goes for another and pushes it out wide to help it swing back in it stays true and Rohit creams a square drive for four. The fifth ball is wide again and Rohit thumps it square with a vertical bat and the ball screams past point’s dive for four. It went too quick for Mahidy and evaded his grasp by about 50cm.  Some grounds for hope for Shoriful, though, when he beats Rohit’s inside edge as he tries a third expansive drive.  Shubman Gill will take first hit. Shoriful has the first new ball.  Bangladesh got off to fantastic start, accelerating judiciously after playing themselves in against the new ball but India’s masterly bowling and electric fielding on a belter of the pitch dragged them back and gives them the prospect of a comfortable chase on a flat track.  Shoriful is greeted by the third yorker in succession but this one is wider and he stabs it through mid-off for a single. Bumrah follows Mustafizur as he backs away with a bouncer so he improvises a forehand smash through cover for a single.  The last ball, though, is full but not the yorker and Shoriful smears it over cover for six! What a shot for a No10 who had only just walked to the crease.  Mahmudullah b Bumrah 46  But not this time. He can’t get his bat down in time and loses middle stump to a brute of a yorker. That would have mande Waqar’s top three.  FOW 248/8 Mahmudullah lbw b Bunmrah  Pinned him with an inswinging yorker but seemed to be heading down. Using a review just because they had two left. Not out. He hit it.  Siraj goes for a fifth-stump line and Mahmudullah walks across and slices a drive over cover for two. The next ball is in the same slot, pace on and Mahmudulla can only drill his attempt at a slog sweep back at the bowler. Never mind, though, as he swipes the next one out of the slot over cow corner for six. Siraj tries to make him fetch it from even further away from his body but sprays it too wide and he will have to have another go.  Mahmudullah skewers the wide yorker for a single to point. Mustafizur can’t beat a diving Kuldeep at shot cover and stays on nought by turning down a single off the last ball to long on to give his partner the strike.  Lovely from Mahmudullah to pick the slower ball and carve it behind point for four. Rohit comes over for a word and Bumrah switches to yorkers and Mahmudullah digs one out for a single. All the Fiz can do is preserve his wicket and ensure, when he ducks the last-ball bumper, that Mahmudullah is on strike. This over has got to go.  Nasum steps to leg to thump a ball off his stumps straight for four. Siraj threw out his left hand and it almost took off the top of the middle finger. He wrings his hand in agony and the physio hotfoots it to the middle with his bag of tricks. After treatment to his non-bowling hand, he resumes. Nasum has a swish at the short one on leg and middle and misses and then has another swing but connects with only fresh air.  Adopting the tactic of the first ball, he steps away to cleave the ball through cover for another four.  But then goes down swinging for Saturn.  Nasum c Rahul b Siraj 14  Hit two fours off the over but had two swishes at fresh air and he was third time unlucky, feathering an edge as he tried to pull a back of a length one.  FOW 233/7 Thakur is back for his final over and Mahmudullah targets him, whisking two through midwicket, pinging four more off his pads and continues with a steepling pull to cow corner for six.  Thankur ends with 9-0-59-1 but the first and ninth over apart (which went for 31 jointly) he did well.  Nasum cannot get going and hares up the other end when chiselling out a Bumrah yorker. Had Siraj’s throw been more accurate, he would be back in the pav, hare or no hare. Mahmudullah glides a single to third man and jams down on the yorker to squirt it for two behind square.   Kuldeep bowls out and bows out for the cost of only four singles. Bangladesh know the jig’s up. Eking out as many as they can may only delay the inevitable barring a bowling miracle.  Bumrah has four overs left and strikes in the first of them with a back-of-a-length cutter that Mushfiqur tries to fillet through point. But Jadeja is a phenomenon. As is Bumrah who greets the new batsman with bouncer, bouncer, yorker that he jabs down on outside off but doesn’t connect. Rahul think he nicked it but that was the sound of bat on pitch.  Mushfiqur c Jadeja b Bumrah 38  The world’s best fielder takes another stunning catch, diving to his right at backward point to grab a lusty square cut with both hands.  FOW 201/6 Jadeja on the squeeze again, giving up just one single to Mushfiqur who tucks it off his pads for a single to fine leg.    Fantastic from Mahmudullah to pick Kuldeep’s leg-break, walk down and cart it over cow corner for six. Kuldeep ups his pace to defend himself, the porcupine’s prickles going up, and Mahmudullah slaps a cut for a single. Mushfiqur works the last ball off the back foot behind square to end a productive over with a single. Jadeja’s penultimate over costs only three singles. He now has 9-0-37-2.  Mushfiqur whisks Siraj for a single off his pads and, after three dot balls, Mahmudullah shuffles back and across to punch a cover drive for four with Swiss timing. Eleven overs to go. How many can they get? I don’t think 250 will be anywhere near enough but it is dependent on these two to get them something they have a prayer of defending.  Mahmudullah is coming in at No7 in Shakib’s absence, pushed one place up the order and his striking power and experience has got to be better deployed here than at his usual position. He opens the face and dabs a single behind point. Mushfiqur cuts to the point sweeper for one and then Mahmadullah goes square on the offside again and slaps his back-cut just in front of the diving Jadeja and backward point. Dicing with danger with Jadeja lurking there.   Hridoy c Gill b Thakur 16  As the sixth bowler with two left because of Pandya’s injury, Thakur was bound to be targeted but Hridoy has struggled with his timing throughout and he is gulled by the slow, cross-seam bouncer, collaring it late and flapping it to midwicket.  FOW 179/5 Towhid Hridoy cannot find the room to free his arms and gets his innings motoring so takes the initiative against Siraj, back for Kuldeep, charging down to toe a drive over mid-on that lands 5m short of the rope and plugs so they can only take two to go with the five singles and a wide that keeps the dots out of the scorebook for one over at least.  There are many ways to skin a cat and eight off the over is decent ... but they have to keep going.  Nice shot from Mushfiqur, opening the face to drive Nasser style through point for four. Cannily he rides the bounce of Bumrah’s back of a length delivery and glides it down to third man for a single. Bumrah keeps Hridoy quiet with cutters, quick and slower ones, playing with his alignment and timing, playing with his mind.  Kuldeep slams the brakes on again. Bangladesh cannot get any momentum going. Thakur has only two overs left but someone has got to go.  Rohit brings back Bumrah for a pre-death burst. Mushfiqur flicks two off his hip that was heading for four until Kuldeep, once the worst fielder in the side, made a headlong dive, lost his Oakleys and snaffled it before bulleting in a throw. Heart in mouth time at the end of the over when Mushfiqur Harrow drives for a single that scoots past off stump on its path to fine leg for a single.  Kuldeep returns with four overs of his 10 to go. Mushfiqur drives through point for a single and jammily takes another one there off a leading edge when trying to work to leg. Towhid drives one down to long off then paddles fine for two. Starting to get busy.  Mushfiqur has waited and waited and now unfurls that slog sweep and plays it beautifully, collaring Jadeja and arcing the ball into the crowd for six in front of square. The next ball is flatter and fuller and Mushfiqur whips the dart off his pads for a single. Towhid, though, cannot beat the infield and Jadeja, as he usually does, gets out of the over with more dot balls than scoring ones.  Haha! You don’t see that very often. Bangladesh run a quick single, Jadeja takes on the throw and hurls down the striker’s stumps with Hridoy comfortably home so they run an overthrow. KL Rahul fields the deflection and tries to run out Hridoy again, this time at the non-striker’s, knocks down the other stumps with him home and they run another buzzer. Sound the village klaxon. That’s a song isn’t it? How one becomes three? Rohit, like a stern father, gives Jadeja and Rahul withering looks.   Hridoy survives an exuberant lbw shout ... by virtue of actually hitting the ball as he defended, chipping it on to his pad, then works Jadeja into the legside for a single. Mushfiqur does play back to Jadeja but it’s a sound ploy when he drops short and the keeper-batsman, Bangladesh’s last hope, chops it for two, bringing up his 1,000th World Cup run in the process.  Spendthrift Thakur turns miser, allowing Bangladesh two singles as they are stuck on the platform built by their openers, utterly incapable of elevating because of tight bowling and gun fielding.  India’s spinners are going to smother teams, break their composure, melt their common sense and carry India to a third World Cup unless someone finds a way to break free.  Das c Shubman b Jadeja 66  Tries to blast his way out of the rut and aims for long-off but he can’t get under it and cloths it to the old Venus fly-tarp hands himself, Shubman Gill. Why oh why oh why? FOW 137/4 Merely a one-over spell for Siraj as Shardul is brought back to bustle in and keep his recovery from that first-over mauling for 16 progressing. He has recovered his line and attacks it outside off with a heavy length.  The wicket has made Das think about the future and the weight of the responsibility makes him far more circumspect against Jadeja than he was when taking him for 10 off his last over. Only a single, cutting, which is the same shot Hridoy uses to double his score.  Rahul and Siraj combine to saw off Mehidy and the fast bowler, dander up, treats Towhid Hridoy to an inswinger, that he flicks off his pads for a single, and Das to the outswinger that whistles past the edge. Siraj tearing up to the crease now, full of beans and swagger.   Mehidy c Rahul b Siraj 3  There are legside strangles that can be put down to batsman error or inability to rein in a lazy instinct. But not this one. It was a perfectly viable glance off the body but Rahul somehow got there to pick off a remarkable catch diving low to his left after rapid footwork across.  FOW 129/3 Das breaks the Jadeja shackles with a lofted check-drive for two followed by a T20 thump through long on, clearing his front leg. The very next ball, pushed fuller, is skelped on the sweep for four more.  Mehidy takes on Siraj’s bouncer and can’t get there with his hook. That doesn’t stop the bowler and fielders appealing for a catch after it thudded into KL’s gloves but he tells them firmly that there was no bat. Mehidy pokes a drive for a single to point and Das works two singles with the angle from over the wicket through midwicket.  Just the single off Jadeja’s third over but some respite now as Rohit wants to have some Kuldeep overs up his sleeve and takes him out of the attack after a six-over spell. Back comes Siraj.  Half-century for Das from a third single off the over, whisking the ball off his toes to bring it up. No bpundaries for more than seven overs now. The spinner suffocation strategy is working … as it usually seems to do. To beat India one team in this tournament is going to have to have the stones to try to break their stranglehold.  The incorrigible Jadeja, always in the game, strikes. The way these two left-armers of contrasting methods rattle through the overs and Kuldeep makes them play back, Jadeja demanding you play off the front foot, scrambles minds. What a double act.   Shanto lbw b Jadeja 8  As every mother tells her infant child these days as if she was warning about the Bogeyman: ‘Don’t go back to Jadeja.’ Shanto didn’t heed the advice and tried to play him on the back foot and the great left-arm spinner skids one through the shot and pins him on the back pad, right in front of middle and leg.  FOW 110/2 Pandya will not be risked in the field and therefore, by missing the rest of the innings, will be prevented from batting until two hours of India’s innings have passed or five wickets are down, whichever is sooner.  Das and Shanto, right- and left-hander, rotate the strike with four singles off Kuldeep, all off the front foot. This is a 350 pitch, says Nasser Hussain. Milking the spinners won’t get them there. They need to push harder in his opinion.  Enter Jadeja with his usual control. They work him around for three singles, should have been four but they manage to steal two off the last delivery when Das drives to the covers weeper whose throw trickles in.  Kuldeep is bowling beautifully and gets his stock ball to rag away from Shanto’s bat. First evidence of the kind of turn that disturbs minds. The over’s four dot balls are bookended by drives for singles off ones that were half an inch too full.  The left-handed stand-in captain Shanto defends the first three balls of Thakur’s over then gets away by working one off his legs for a single. Das drives crisply twice but can only glean something off the second of them, beating mid-on’s shy to complete the single.   ‘Very good, very good Kuldeep,’ yells KL in encouragement and next ball the left-arm wrist-spinner diddles the well-set Tanzid with his slider. Very good indeed.  Tanzid lbw b Kuldeep 51  Drinks break strikes again, the greatest wicket assister in the game. Misjudgement from the 22-year-old, trying to sweep the flipper that skidded on and trapped him on the shin in front of middle.  FOW 93/1 Tanzid reaches a maiden ODI half-century off 41 balls after thumping Thakur over cover for four and then elongates a defensive to cover for a single. Time for a drink … India might need one.  Here’s Virat’s Procky tribute: Litton Das is a joy to watch when in this kind of nick and he shuffles back to Kuldeep’s slightly slower ball and flays it through cover for four. The next ball is fuller and the orthodox one from the left-arm wristy and Das uses the turn to whisk it for a well-run two. Two singles and a wide complete another good over for the Bangladesh openers who have now posted a World Cup record for the Tigers for a first-wicket partnership.  Rohit has his four men on the boundary for Thakur at backward point, third man, fine leg and backward square. It’s going to be back of a length all the way, then and he delivers a much tighter over in which he is taken for a two and two singles and Das has to come down to reassure young Tanzid that all is going well when he spears a drive that was technically a caught and bowled chance but only for those with Inspector Gadget telescopic arms and asbestos hands. Don’t throw it away now, is the gist of Das’s point, as he gets frustrated by his inability to find the rope.  Rohit was going to bring Jadeja on but switches to Kuldeep just as ‘Sir Jadeja’ was removing his sun hat. Das on-drives for a single, Tanzid does the same, in mirror image, then Das lofts a straight drive that looked as if it would skid away for four but for SKY, on as a sub, to claw it back and keep him to two.  Kuldeep beats Das with a slider outside off as he tried to late cut. No flight to get under, Kuldeep has become a master of his domain. No, not like that Seinfeld fans.  Thakur, a bowler Rohit doesn’t seem to trust, is given the last over of the first Powerplay and Tanzid takes him on, smacking him for 6-4-6 off successive balls. The first is a smooth and stylish pick up, all wrists and flashing blade, over square leg. Next ball Tanzid chassés down and heaves the ball over long on and he ends his blitz picking the slower ball and flaying it over extra-cover to make it 16 off the over.  Bangladesh’s batting coach has clearly told his boys to use their feet to the quicks and Litton does it again to Hardik, smearing a drive over cover from two strides down for four. Because he made that into a half-volley, Pandya goes fuller and Das hammers a drive past the bowler that screams to the fence. Pandya fell over in his followthrough and seems to have sprained his ankle and jarred his knee. On comes the physio and a lengthy spell of treatment ensues that is still ongoing ... get him off the field and get on with the game.  After about eight minutes he is passed fit to continue but is hobbling badly and before he delivers it, decides to go off.  Virat Kohli is going to finish his over! The crowd goes wild! Three balls of golden arm filth off the wrong foot to come. He hasn’t bowled in an ODI for six years.  Starts with an inducker that Das defends and then another that the right-hander flicks through mid-on for a single. Tanzid ends his spell with a push through cover for one more.   Nice footwork and bold intent from Tanzid to skip down to Siraj and slice him deliberately over backward point for four. Siraj responds with a bouncer but it is too short and Tanzid ducks it, happy to take the wide rather than take it on. When Siraj pitches up, Tanzid waltzes down again and harpoons a straight drive off one leg past the bowler for four. Such a handsome shot, little wonder he holds the pose. Tanzid, perhaps stung by Das’s anger for not ebing alert enough to steal a single when the right-hander dropped the ball into the offside, larrups the final ball of Bumrah’s typically Scrooge and Marley over for six. The left-hander leaned back and used the right-armer’s angle from over the wicket to dump it over third man.  Das starts to cook, targeting Siraj and gorging on a short one to carve it with monstrous power for four. Siraj goes fuller and Das plays a gorgeous inside-out midwicket whisk, taking a step across the crease to ping it as he pirouetted on his front foot through midwicket for four. Siraj doesn’t take that lying down, though, and jags the final ball into his bat handle, jarring his wrists and elbows so hard he takes a hand off as the ball trickles down to third man for a single.  Do you remember when Richie Benaud would sometime say ‘Good cricket, that’ when batsman, bowler and fielder excelled? Had he been spared to be here, he would have been saying it about Bumrah’s first ball, a venomous inswinging yorker to Tanzid who chisels it out and then hares a single ... But then again, maybe not as a replay later in the over shows that it was a pad-flick first and hence he would have been plumb had India resorted to DRS, which they didn’t as it wasn’t discernible at Bumrah’s pace.  Das works a single to midwicket and Tanzid throws the bat at the last ball, aiming to whip it through midwicket but instead squirts it down to third man for two off a leading edge.  Magnificent opening spell so far from the best white-ball bowler around.  India have two slips for Das but it’s more like a first and third slip and the wider man stops Das running the ball away down to third man for a strike-rotating single. Siraj keeps him stuck on strike for four dot balls. Something’s got to give.  Three-card trick from Bumrah to Das: outswinger, outswinger, pins him with an inswinger that was an inch or two too high as it tailed in on to the top of his right flap. The fielders go up but Bumrah isn’t interested in a review. Sagacious chap and he ends a testing maiden the master of economy, scrambling Das’s radar with the swinging ball so much that he misses out on the one hooping into his toes. Up goes the drone to show us a ridiculously long queue to get into the stadium, snaking back across the overpass, about a kilometre in length.  Tanzid throws the bat at Siraj’s first ball, as if he cares not a jot about the two slips, and flashes a drive through the air past a diving Rohit at shortish extra-cover. The ball races away for four streakily but how many not how is all that goes in the scorebook. It demonstrates his desire to tee off and a general skittishness early on to some deliveries but then he plays two impeccably judged defensives to rising balls. The ground will be rammed by the time India bat and the working day is drawing to a close but it’s less than half full at the moment.  Jasprit Bumrah opens the bowling. Pitch looks a belter – the opening weeks of every World Cup (bar 1999 in an English May) are Lotus Lands for batsmen. Bumrah is firing from the off, up at 88mph and hooping it away from the left-handed Tanzid. He leaves two well alone and lets them through to Rahul until he gets one on off stump that he can push defensively to cover for a single. Bumrah beats the right-handed Das all ends up with a jaffa that angles in from that extraordinary action, pitches on off and rips past the edge as Das propped forward.  India  Rohit Sharma (capt), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj. Bangladesh  Litton Das, Tanzid Hasan, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Najmul Hossain Shanto (capt), Mushfiqur Rehman (wk), Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud.  But it’s Najmul Hossain Shanto who is calling for Bangladesh which means that Shakib has failed his fitness test. That’s a debilitating disappointment for Bangladesh. Any road … Shanto calls correctly and Bangladesh will bat first.  Good morning and welcome to live coverage of India vs Bangladesh from Pune in its debut match of the tournament. India have looked a millionbillion dollars so far in the tournament, emerging from a tricky start with the bat in their chase against Australia to fillet the five-times champions before sweeping Afghanistan and Bangladesh aside. Bangladesh, by contrast, began with a convincing victory over Afghanistan but looked well short against England in Dharamshala and were hammered by the all-conquering Kiwis, who, like they did in 2015 and 2019, have started like a rocket. India have never lost an ODI against Bangladesh at home (though technically this is a neutral venue) but, much to their chagrin, a team including Ganguly, Sehwag, Dravid, Yuvraj, Harbhajan, Agarkar and Zaheer were beaten by five wickets in Port of Spain, a defeat that effectively holed their campaign below the waterline and hastened their departure at the earliest opportunity.  Bangladesh can also celebrate victory in their last meeting in the Asia Cup Super Fours 34 days ago in Colombo, when Shakib made 80 and the Fiz took three for 50. They also made a good fist of their match at Edgbaston at the last World Cup, falling 28 runs short when they were bowled out by Jasprit Bumrah (four for 55) and Hardik Pandya (three for 60) so, while most experts are banking on another India cakewalk, there are grounds for optimism – none more so than Netherlands’ gritty and skilful Himalayan victory over the hitherto unbeaten South Africans.  India have lost three of seven ODIs at the new stadium in Pune and pace and skiddy spin have always prospered there. Should be a good match.  "
Reece Topley makes convincing case to lead England’s seam attack,11 Oct 2023 • 11:10 pm,England’s win over Bangladesh proved it was match practice they badly lacked in the opener against New Zealand but also the value of the specialist was underlined by the performance of Reece Topley...
Dawid Malan and Reece Topley star as England get back on track with Bangladesh hammering,10 Oct 2023 • 7:10 pm,"In December 2020, Dawid Malan was feared too old to make it to the 2023 World Cup. Asked to explain Malan’s omission from England’s one-day international squads while he was excelling in T20, then captain Eoin Morgan asked: “Is a 36 or 37-year-old going to be able to maintain the intensity of a World Cup game?” Three years on, Malan delivered an emphatic answer, underpinning England’s 364-9 with a rapid 140. The returning Reece Topley’s electric new-ball burst then secured a restorative 137-run victory over Bangladesh. In just 23 ODIs, Malan has now scored six centuries — all in different countries, a testament to his adaptability. This sextet has taken in some of the most picturesque grounds in the world: the charming VRA Ground, nestled in a park in the Amsterdam suburbs; Adelaide Oval and its lush green banks; the tradition of Lord’s. Yet, for sheer viewing experience, none can match the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala. Looking out into the top of the Himalayas, pockets of snow were discernible from the rainbow of multicoloured seats. It is the ultimate enclave from a turbulent world. For all the dramatic thunder overnight and fears — which happily didn’t materialise — about the outfield, Malan recognised that the Dharamsala wicket was excellent to bat on, even with early moisture that meant that both captains wanted to bowl. While he has been cast as a more sedate alternative to the buccaneering Jason Roy as Jonny Bairstow’s opening partner, two sixes in the first seven overs — a flick and a pull, both off left-armer Mustafizur Rahman — indicated Malan’s early ambitions. These early sixes were also evidence of the calculating nature of Malan’s batsmanship: both were to the shortest of the square boundaries, an inviting 61 metres. Malan’s cricketing acumen was in evidence, too, as he four times followed up one boundary against a bowler with another the next ball, often sensing a bowler’s propensity to overcorrect for the previous delivery. After the hooked six, Mustafizur overcorrected: Malan crunched a full toss down the ground for another four. When Shoriful Islam had been heaved through the leg side, Malan received a fuller delivery, which he glided through the vacant slip for a boundary. While Jonny Bairstow reached his half-century in 54 balls, Malan got there in 15 fewer.   The opening stand of 115 ensured that England were in an early position of ascendancy. Malan and Joe Root ensured they did not relinquish it. It was once said that the pair were too similar to play in the same team; only once in Malan’s first 18 ODIs did he play alongside, rather than instead of, Root. In Dharamsala, their contrasting styles — the right-handed Root favouring scoring behind the wicket, including through his scoops, while the left-handed Malan used his power to crunch the ball in front of square — yielded a 151-run stand. Once he had the satisfaction of reaching a 91-ball century, Malan became rampant. In the 33rd over, against off spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Malan slog-swept a four, which led to Mehidy switching to over the wicket. Presented with a shorter delivery, Malan clobbered a six over midwicket; Mehidy then overpitched in response, and was launched down the ground for six. Mehidy ended the over trying to fire in a quicker delivery; Malan backed away to give himself room, and thrashed a four through the off side, exploiting the gaps that his leg side hitting had created. Nearly 13 overs remained when Malan was bowled for 140, trying to thrash Mahedi Hasan. But, even if he missed a chance to better Ben Stokes’s England ODI record score — 182, set only four games ago — Malan is still creating his own history. In 17 games since Matthew Mott took over as head coach, Malan averages 69.5 while scoring at a strike rate of 100. He has emphatically made good on his longstanding claim that ODIs are his best format. And, no matter that he is into his 37th year, there are few indications of his body struggling to cope with the intensity that a World Cup demands. The same, of course, is true of Root. Before the tournament he faced questions concerning his ODI form rather than age, but has now made scores of 77 and 82, becoming England’s highest ever World Cup run-scorer in the process. Even with a stuttering end — 68-7 from their last 10.3 overs, flummoxed by Shoriful’s slower balls and Mahedi’s variations of pace — England still scored 364-9. Another reason for this late innings strife was a longer tail: the result of Topley replacing Moeen Ali. Yet Topley swiftly endorsed the view that a side with four seamers is altogether better balanced. Swinging the new ball at pace, Topley claimed three wickets inside his first three overs. The best delivery was reserved for Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh’s captain: pitching on a good length, it got a scintilla of swing, defeated the outside edge and kissed the top of off stump. It was a dismissal that embodies why, with his natural shape, Topley is a particular asset against left-handers: in ODIs, he now averages 30 against right-handers but just 18 against southpaws. Yet the addition of Topley was not the only change from England’s shoddy bowling performance against New Zealand. The men who retained their berths also showed a marked improvement: after a wayward start, Chris Woakes gradually found his immaculate length; Mark Wood found better accuracy to go with 94mph pace; and Adil Rashid showed off a sumptuous googly to bowl Mahedi. It was so brilliant that, just fleetingly, the spectators could be distracted from the view. England captain Jos Buttler: “I think a really good performance to bounce back from a disappointing first game and we still feel there are areas to improve. “I thought it was a fantastic score on that pitch, it got harder towards the end but we could’ve got more at the back end. Some big partnerships at the start, excellent from Dawid Malan to take a lead. “I think you’re always looking for the perfect performance, the turnover from 30-40 we scored about 100 runs. That 30-40 period was very smart. There’s not many times you come off and don’t think there’s many areas to improve which is great. “It’s going to be one of the challenges of the tournament, reading the pitch well and our options. The guys on the bench are great, we’ve got different options. Reece Topley was great today coming in and got big early wickets in the powerplay.” Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan: “It was colder weather than the last game, you could even see the snow. That could have helped our bowlers, but we didn’t start well enough. If you give them a sniff, they will always come hard. “We had a good plan, but we couldn’t execute. The ball swung nicely for five or six overs, but we couldn’t land the ball often enough. “They could have scored 380 or 390, but we restricted them well. 330 we might have fancied our chances, but we needed a good start and didn’t get that. “It’s a long tournament and we can’t put our heads down. We have to move on and think all of the positives we have been doing, focus on one game at a time.” On what was behind his innings: “I’m going to say experience if anything. It’s nice to contribute, it’s been a long journey to get here. I don’t know what it’s down to but hopefully, it continues.” Does it help when your number three batter is Joe Root, can you express yourselves more?: “When you’ve got Joe Root at number three, it allows us to play with freedom.” ...no shock there.  Good from England. Much needed. After the chaos of Ahmedabad Jos Buttler’s side appear to have found their groove. A solid score, built from the top by Dawid Malan and Joe Root, and an excellent bowling display headlined by Reece Topley were more than enough to get them over the line.  A good result for the tournament? Perhaps not. A ;good result for the defending champions? Very much so. Curran finishes the job by clean bowling the stubborn Taskin. Job done for England. Wood will bowl his full allocation and strats with a quick bumper that has Taskin on the hop. A couple more singles follow, this game is crying to be put to bed but these tailenders have done well to see out another rapid Mark Wood over. You wonder the value of Mark Wood bowling as many as nine overs here. He will be needed later in this tournament and with this game wrapped up he surely could have been spared a couple of overs. Four from that Curran over. Credit to England for a very dominant performance and they are back on track but this has been an incredibly dull game of ODI cricket. The tournament really needs lift off with a close match. We haven’t had one yet, and it does feel like most teams (not all) are still shaking out the rustiness and getting used to the format again.   Mustafizur does well first ball to dig out a rapid yorker from Wood. England one away here. Islam b Wood 12 Bowled him! 91 mph and round the wicket from Wood. The batter simply has no chance. FOW: 221/9 Curran returns to the attack for the final few overs. A lovely slower ball deceives Islam, who’s so early on the pull that he almost does a pirouette before the ball reaches Buttler. Islam then climbs into a powerful drive, Rashid thinks about diving but thinks better of it on this sticky ground and Islam picks up a boundary. The final ball also goes for four, flat-batted down the ground for four. Livingstone comes round the wicket to Taskin, looking to move the ball away from the left-hander with his off breaks. Taskin gets on one knee and sends one high into the stands for the six. The direction of spin really doesn’t matter when you middle one like that.  Rashid will fancy picking up these last couple of wickets now and judging by Islam’s wild swipe he might well be in buisness.  Sorry for some technical issues there. We’re back up and running. Hasan b Rashid 14 Lovely googly from Rashid and he has a much-deserved wicket. FOW: 195/8 The right-hand, left-hand combination means Livingstone can bowl his off-spin to the left-hander and his leg-spin to the right-hander. Talent... Lovely first over that.   Towhid Hridoy c Buttler b Livingstone 39 With his first ball! Livingstone finds the perfect length immediately, getting one to turn sharply  and bounce off a length. It takes a little nick off Hridoy’s outside edge. FOW: 189/7  Hasan takes a huge swipe at a wide one from Rashid but is completely deceived by the googly. So was Jos Buttler by the look of it. Hasan then goes aerial, looking to loft Rashid over mid-on. It’s not timed but it lands safe and they get back for a couple. Wood continues despite looking fairly well gassed after his last over and suitably starts with a wide. He then goes too full and Hridoy just leans into a drive. Perfectly timed and it races without wide mid-off for four. Wood looks a little lethargic as he moves back towards his mark. Altitude and spongy outfield look like they make bowling quickly on this deck pretty hard work. Rashid returns. This feels like a perfect chance for him to snare himself a couple of late wickets. He goes high and wide and Hasan smacks it straight to Topley at mid-on, who shells the catch. It came quickly but that really should have been taken. Rashid looks justifiably disappointed at that effort. Wood has been superb in this spell. Pace down slightly but he’s been right on the money since coming back into the attack. As I type he really bends his back, getting one right up into the ribs of Hridoy, who has to take evasive action.  Is Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium the most picturesque in the world? It simply has to be on the shortlist. Nothing quite like the look of disappointment on a fast bowler’s face when called into action immediately after bowling an over. Wood is called into action four times in as many balls as Hasan and Hridoy settle for ones down to third man. Topley’s excellent spell comes to an end...4/43 from his 10 overs. Wood’s pace is pretty good here and surely England could risk a slightly more attacking field.  A slip maybe? Wood goes full and Hasan laces a cover drive but fails to beat the man in the ring. Just one from the over. England are throttling Bangladesh here. This England side looks far more balanced with Topley in it. His ability to perform different roles with the ball during an innings is invaluable, as he’s showing here in these gritty middle overs. Excellent fielding from LIvingstone at point, diving to his left to prevent the single. Still no acceleration from Bangladesh...no time like the present methinks.  Wood back into the attack as England press for an early finish here. Hasan is off the mark with a dab down to third-man. Hridoy is surely the man to go now, he’s looked good for his 20-odd so far and now batting with the tail, he’s running out of partners at the other end. Very good over from Wood – just two from it. That’s four for Topley now... Mushfiqur b Topley c Rashid 51 Another for Topley. Short and wide but with a little more zip. Mushfiqur looks to cut but gets a flyer off the edge sending the ball hurtling down the throat of Adil Rashid at third-man. England have that last vital breakthrough. FOW: 164/6 Mushfiqur gets to a gritty 50 after nudging one into the leg side for a single. Bangladesh’s chances are not indelibly tied to him remaining at the crease for the majority of what is left of this innings. It’s only England’s second game in this tournament but already it is their final all-day match. Their last seven qualifiers are day-nighters starting with Afghanistan on a predicted belter in Delhi. Not that Afghanistan have been at their best: they have lost their last seven ODIs.  Poor from Topley. He’s back over the wicket and serves up a juicy half-volley on leg stump. Hridoy  doesn’t miss out, clipping the ball powerfully for four, perfectly dissecting the men at fine leg and deep mid-wicket. This is a different challenge for Topley now. The ball was moving and nipping at the top of the innings. This will be all about varying pace and length on what is a pretty good batting wicket still. Adil Rashid thinks he has Hridoy trapped LBW and so does the umpire. The finger goes u8p but there’s an immediate review from Hridoy. Reply shows a feather inside edge and he survives. Required rate is approaching ten an over for Bangladesh. Here’s Reece Topley coming back, round the wicket to change the line of attack, seeing he will not be able to extract as much bounce as did with the new ball and the swing has packed its bags and hotfooted it to the airport. Mushfiqur pings two off his pads then ends the over harpooning four through extra. Shot!  Bangladesh need 221 from 138.  Time for Tom Ward to take the blog home.  Just the two singles off Rashid who dials down the pace and is turning the ball both ways. Hridoy looks uncertain and doesn’t seem to have the sweep in his armoury.  Chris Woakes carries on, largely using the slower ball now as his chief weapon, playing with the batsmen’s timing and racking up five dot balls with his cutters. As Eoin Morgan identified, the line was the problem early on  and since tightening it, he has been much more effective, Hridoy, only scoring off a short ne which he pulls for two.  Much better from Rashid who, like Woakes and Wood, was short of a gallop after an injury-hit white-ball season at home. Mushfiqur pushes a single through mid-off and Hridoy closes the face to work one into the legside.  Mushfiqur drives for a single and pulls Woakes for another. Hridoy Harrow drives for a single off a chunky inside edge then cross-bats a cut in front of point for two.  Turn for Rashid as he cranks up his pace for the leg-break and they find the gaps to glean five singles. Hridoy picks the googly and sweeps it with the turn for one.  Wood is sent for a rest on the boundary and a gulp of refreshment supplied by Ben Stokes. Woakes is back, Buttler determined to give him a proper gallop to find his best form and he gets his man. Das can’t believe the cutter, that he picked, didn’t jag back in as he tried to dab it. Woakes signalled the slower ball was coming and Buttler walked in two paces which proved crucial to grabbing the catch.   Das c Buttler b Woakes 76  Terrific bowling change from Buttler and Woakes has his got his mojo rising. Slower ball, cutter, and Das feathers it through.  FOW 121/5 Bangladesh are not daunted by the scale of their chase with four down, working Rashid around for four singles before Litton Das slog sweeps him over wide long on for six.  Heck of a shot, that and 249 from 30 overs is not impossible. Taking 10 an over off the last two is a big boost to their confidence.  Mushfiqur hits the gas by caressing a cover drive off Curran’s first ball for four, pulling for a single and then chips four more in front of short third man. Time for spin. Buttler calls up Rashid. That was BAngladesh’s best over since thrashing Woakes’ first for 12. Wood is enjoying a fourth over, getting some work into those legs after such a long lay-off. He tries three shorter ones and three fuller, each above 90mph. Mushfiqur drives him for a single to cover, Das pops one off his pads and Mushfiqur takes the strike with a cover drive for a third single off the over.  Das pulls Curran for two and uses the outside third of his bat to guide two singles down to third man. Mushfiqur takes a single to that fielder, too, and the cover sweeper. Mushfiqur uses Wood’s pace to open the face and steer the ball past Root, standing deep at slip, for four. Wood is storming into the crease, no sign of the heel injury that has sideline him since the Oval. Mishfiqur flips a single off his hip and Das leans back to guide a single down too third man.  FWIW Bangladesh need 278 off 204 balls, a tick over eight an over in old currency.  Six singles and a wide amount to seven off Sam Curran’s third over, the wide a Dernbachy slower ball variation that slipped out wrong. On come the drinks.  Wood is as consistently quick as he was in 2019. Nursing him along for four years has been worthwhile if he can rock up in the middle of the Ashes and at the start of the World Cup, full fit and with searing pace. Das almost drags on a 92mph length ball, Harrow driving it past the stumps and down to fine leg. In the Bangladesh coaching box, Allan Donald tosses a rugby ball while watching Wood. Game knows game.  Curran tries a variety of slower balls, using contrasting lengths and grips to stop the batsmen settling. They work three singles as they try to rebuild towards some sort of base camp from which a summit may be plausible but England are fully in control so far.   Double change: Mark Wood replaces Topley and he takes no time to reach express pace, breaching 92mph with his fourth ball, rushing the batsmen. Only the one topple in his followthrough, Timber!, and only three runs off his first over, one sliced to third man, deflecting the pace, one flicked through midwicket and one off the hip.  First change: Sam Curran replaces Woakes. It is boy stood on the burning deck stuff from Das, using his feet and improvising a short-arm pull round the corner for four then, after exchanging singles with Mushfiqur, brings up a 38-ball fifty by chopping Curran’s slower cutter down to third man for one.  Das takes on the pull and swipes at fresh air, spinning so quickly, such was the force, that he was facing Buttler when the ball flies into his gloves. The next ball is also short on a much wider line and he flips it off his hip for six, bruising Topley’s figures to three for 18. That’s the first Powerplay done.   Three wickets for Reece Topley in his first three overs, bowling like a dream - all 3 lefties, who he is particularly good against, using his natural shape to curve the ball away.  England look a stronger team with him in and four seamers.  Woakes repairs his figures to 5-0-37-1. Eoin Morgan, who remains close enough to the dressing room not to be critical in public of the NCOs of his 2015-19 corps says merely that Woakes’ line is wrong, not his length nor pace. And by going fourth-stump, he duly gets his reward.  Mehidy c Buttler b Woakes 8  Shows you what I know. I would have sent Woakes for a breather but Buttler perseveres, thinking he can bowl him back into form and he repays the debt to his captain, going fuller and tailing it away as Mehidy went for the big drive but merely snicking it.  FOW 49/4 But that is classic Woakes, fourth stump line and a hint of shape away, dismissing Das.  Das taps Topley off middle through mid-on. Wood dives cautiously, going down in instalments, to take the heat off it rather than stopping it. The right-hander then works a single through square leg, Mehidy slaps one past point and then has a big swipe at the last ball and is hit amidships. Ouch!  Mr and Mrs Topley booked their air tickets to Australia for the last T20 World Cup, only to find that Reece had been injured out of the tournament as soon as they arrived. This time they waited to buy until the tournament had started. The tall left-armer has made all the difference to England’s bowling. He seems to be at the peak of his career. Chris Woakes on the other hand might be past the peak of last summer. As suggested during England’s last game against NZ, their best opening attack would be Topley and Sam Curran. Sean Pollock has just dubbed England’s opponents ‘the Bangladeshians’ which makes them sound like an old boys; touring XI. Woakes and Topley, one may cruelly say echoing Graham Gooch re New Zealand in 1983, ‘World XI at one end, Ilford seconds at the other’.  Mehidy drives Woakes uppishly for four then smears a cover drive for three. Woakes then spears one into Das’s pads and the right-handed opener whisks it through midwicket with a lovely bottom-hand flourish for four.  Rashid chases down the on-drive off the last ball and claws it back, his knee by design, not accident, landing on the boundary cushion not the crumbling outfield. He saves one as they run three again.  Chris Woakes has struggled in these first two games and despite his Ashes heroics. It is a reminder of his ineffectiveness overseas. Woakes would normally be a cert to tour this winter after such a good summer in Test cricket but he should not be considered for the five Tests in India in the new year. Wicket maiden for Reece Topley who has been the unluckiest of all international cricketers. Fantastic for him and a real testament to his courage and skill. After three overs he has 3-1-6-3. Shakib b Topley 1 Ripper! My word! Unplayable. Angles it in to off and middle, Shakib tried to work it through midwicket but it straightened as he closed the face, whistled past the bat and crashed into the top of off. FOW 26/3 Das is finding Woakes easier to play and simply bides his time until served up a half-volley which he harpoons through cover for four. Bad ball, good shot. Some encouraging swing for Woakes but the seam may offer better rewards.  Great story for Reece Topley, after the pain of missing last year’s T20 World Cup with a late injury.    Litton Das uses Topley’s inswing when he starts on a middle-stump line to flick it fine for a single. Topley troubles him with the extra bounce generated by his height and snappy wrist, clocking him on the fingers. When he pins Das Topley races towards the batsman and turns, beseeching so convincingly Buttler goes for a review that had almost nothing to recommend it when seen in slow motion.  Pitched outside leg. England lose a review.  Das lbw b Topley  Where did it pitch?  Litton Das pushes Woakes for a single into the legside and Shakib gets off the mark by steering a single down to third man. Woakes is picked off for being too straight, Das working it off middle for a single but, with three dot balls, that represents an improvement for England’s attack leader, particularly given Shakib almost plays on when he defends with soft hands and the ball carroms back off the pitch and just evades the stumps.  Swing straightaway for Topley to the left-handed Tanzid Hasan who plays the first ball with the outside third of his bat, guiding it down to third man for a single. Now he swings it in to Das and ties him up, inside-edging it on to his pads and sprinting a single.  The left-armer rips out the two left-handers and Shakib, their best bat and best player who scored 600+ runs in England in 2019, is in to face the hat-trick ball. It hits him on the pad but was always shaping down.  Shanto c Livingstone b Topley 0 Bang! Bang! He’s on a hat-trick! Drives a fullish outswinger and spoons it to point’s right.  FOW 14/2 Tanzid c Bairstow b Topley 1  Swings it away from the right-hander who nicks off to second slip as he played away from his body. FOW 14/1 Woakes has the new ball and seemed to have lost his Ashes zip at Ahmedabad. He starts with another gentle one that doesn’t swing and Das defends then leaves the next, which does swing away. Woakes bangs the third ball in and Das pulls it through square leg for four, like knocking the cap off a schoolboy’s head. Oh dear ... Woakes looks pedestrian in India. Will he find his mojo or is this a tour too far for England’s home specialist?  Das thumps the fourth ball in the air through point for four and then pulls the next one for a third successive boundary.  Jos Buttler convenes a huddle and addresses his men before they disperse to their fielding positions.  Come the back end of this tournament it is nice if your lower order have had a few innings. The best batting sides can go into the knockout stages without their tailenders having had a knock. Nevertheless, although England paced their innings and evaluated risk better than against New Zealand, it would be nice if they had a specialist batsman marshalling an assault at the end of an innings, not tailenders trying to bat through.  England would have been very happy with that before play but not at 307 for three with fifty balls left. But the Tyke top three all made very valuable contributions and have given Bangladesh a target they have never yet surmounted in ODIs batting second. And credit to Bangladesh, particularly Mahedi who took four for 71 after an early shellacking.  It’s a belter of a pitch but they really should have enough.  Stuttering end to the innings from England – 68-7 from their last 10.3 overs, with Shoriful’s slower balls and Mahedi’s variations of pace both very effective. But, even on this excellent batting track, 364 is still a daunting total. England also have an extra specialist bowler, with Reece Topley in for Moeen Ali.    Woakes smacks an on-drive for four off Taskin’s first ball then falls chasing a wide one. Topley plays at fresh air when trying to swipe a yorker then heaves another down to long on for a single. Wood plinks a drive back to the bowler then burgles a bye through to the keeper to wrap up the innings.  Looks a decent score, despite the wobble at the death from England. They just have a softer underbelly than they did in 2019, especially with Stokes not in the side.   Woakes c Mahedi b Taskin 14  Would have been a wide had he left it alone but went for it having stepped back to leg and spooned a very full delivery off the toe to point.  FOW 362/9 Rashid whisks two off his pads then sweeps Mahedi for four before holing out on the boundary. Enter Mark Wood, hero of Headingley, who starts with a cover drive for two and then walks down to thump four through mid-off.  Rashid c Shanto b Mahedi 11  Relay catch, Hridoy saving six with a deft flick back from the rope before his foot touched the pyramids that was snatched by Shanto.  FOW 352/8   Rashid uses his wrists to show his class as a batsman, gliding two singles down to third man either side of a pull for two that lands juts short of Tanzid at midwicket. The fielder gives it his all, hurling himself to stop it on the bounce and save the boundary, But Woakes does find the rope, flicking Shoriful from middle and leg down behind square leg. Bangladesh have passed their time limit for finishing this innings and will have to bring an extra man into the circle for the final two overs. ‘Criminal,’ says Eoin Morgan and, given we’ve had 23 overs of spin he might have a point.  Bangladesh are stripping some of the gloss off England’s innings, having switched to death bowling from the 35th over onwards. The spinner again lured Curran wide after a couple of dot balls. Great catch but very canny bowling.  Curran c Shanto 11  Takes a blinder, diving at long off after running to his left and taking the plunge on this outfield. Mahedi has three wickets now.  FOW 334/7 England are fading here: from 296-2 off 39.3 overs, they had designs on 400, but now might not even reach 360.  Bangladesh tie England up, Shoriful with some excellent death tactics conceding a two and a pair of singles, checking England’s surge.  Well, you could knock me down with a feather. Big dog heads up the road.     Brook smacks the low full toss from Mahedi through midwicket for four but then the off-spinner does Brook like he did Root by holding the next ball back and tossing it higher. Brook mistimed it and popped up a catch. They may think they have enough but it will take a good bowling performance on a pitch as good as this one to get home and they should remember they need to repair the run-rate damage inflicted on them by New Zealand. So 400 was not just a milestone but a goal.  Brook c Das b Mahedi 20  England are in danger of leaving themselves high and dry with balls to spare here by not playing smartly. Brook drops to one knee and is done by the flight, slicing his mow across the line to long off when aiming for midwicket.  FOW 327/6 He tries the slower ball to bag three in a row but Curran is patient and waits for it before whisking it round the corner for two. Varying his pace and length brings Shoriful three dot balls but when he pushes it fuller Curran creams a drive through extra-cover for four.  Lovely bit of bowling from Shoriful – and England in danger of losing their way. Around the time Malan got out, it was possible to envisage a day where England corrected their net run rate nightmare from last week by making a massive score and winning big. They are still in a great position, but will want to add a few more yet. Over to you, Harry ...  Brook seizes the day to drive Mustafizur for four before ending Mustafizur’s work by feasting on a short ball and hammering his pull for four more. The Fiz ends with 10-0-70-0.  Shoriful is on a hat-trick ... Well, well, well. Root’s shot was a minute miscalculation, Livingstone’s dismissal was a classic commentator’s curse. ‘There can be no more perfect scenario for England to want Livingstone to come to the crease,’ said Michael Atherton Brilliant bowling in both instances though.  Livingstone b Shoriful 0  Golden duck and two in two for Shoriful who is on a hat-trick at the strart of his next over. Does him with a gorgeous off-cutter that sears past the edge and knocks off stump out of the ground.  FOW 307/5 Root c Mushfiqur b Shoriful 82  Done by the slower ball, Root swings across the line, gets a leading edge off the knuckle ball and the keeper runs round to short leg to pouch the sky-er.  FOW 307/4 England pass 300 when Brook works two off his hip. Mustafizur is using the cutter as his stock ball and messing with their timing, bowling it into the pitch, back of a length, keeping them down to four more singles. Considering the carnage England threatened at one point (yes, by pre 2015 standards this is unprecedented English carnage) Bangladesh have done pretty well over the past 10 overs.  Masterly bowling from Shoriful to go yorker, yorker, wide knuckle ball after watching his first ball fly over extra-cover for four.  Buttler b Shoriful 20  Dragged on. Death bowling par excellence. Two yorkers are followed by the knuckle ball. Buttler has to eait and wait and then plays on off the bottom edge as he tried to smack it over cow.  FOW 296/3 Buttler rides his luck by slicing the Fiz’s slower ball that arcs over point and lands between him as he ran back and the sweeper who ran forward. England jog a single. A cover drive earns Buttler two, a pull two more and he gives Root the strike with a crisp tap to long off.  Root repays his captain’s gift by tucking into Mustafizur’s slow cutter, waiting for it and clobbering it over mid-on with a cross-bat cart.  Jos Buttler, by promoting himself to number four and going after the bowling from ball one, has taken it upon himself to rectify England’s run rate after Ahmedabad. Playing a shot a ball…  Malan starts with a four that he laces behind square but is out next ball. Buttler judiciously promotes himself above Brook and decides not to give Livingstone an early hit on his favourite IPL ground. The captain starts with a two eased through the offside and then heaves six straight back over Mahedi’s head, no timing but those fast hockey hands doing all the work. He digs out the quicker one for a single and Root ends the over on the charge, spanking an off-drive aerially for four.  Malan b Mahedi 140  Having just brought up the 150 partnership the previous ball, Malan falls trying to mow a flighted, one that Mahedi held back a touch and crashed into off.  FOW 268/2 Good lord, Malan’s bat is a beauty, as if it has velvet-lined meat. Taksin drops short and Malan swivels to lift him 15 rows back at cow corner, the sound of leather on willow or, rather, willow on leather, as pleasing as the last time Glenn Gould cracked his knuckles. England harvest four mores ingles and a leg-bye. What can England learn from this bowling? That Topley’s height and Wood’s pace gives them a big point of difference.    Shoriful, the left-arm quick, comes round the wicket to Root and gets his length wrong. Root swings through the slot and swats it through midwicket for four. He whisks two more off his pads which takes him to 898 runs, one more in World Cups than Graham Gooch, England’s previous record-holder for this tournament. Having missed out on the ramp the previous ball, Root walks down and helicopters his bat through the horizontal to thrash it for four through mid-on.  Dawid Malan’s extraordinary ODI record continues: now six centuries in 23 ODIs, with all in his last 17 games took over.   The over after reaching a 91-ball ton, a brilliant four-ball against Miraz’s off spin:  - Slog swept Miraz for 4 - Miraz then went over the wicket: slog swept 6 - Next ball 6 over long on - Next ball Malan backed away giving himself room and drove through the covers Magnificent effort from Hridoy to leap to his right to catch Root’s legside flick which he ends up tipping over the bar. Ian Ward calls it a drop on commentary. It’s a wonder he got there at all. Couple of wides follow for the disappointed Taksin, the first down the legside, the next a loopy bumper to Root.  He takes the pace off, messes with Root’s timing and, the extras not withstanding, gets out of an eight ball over for the cost of only three more runs off the bat.  As Nasser Hussain points out, Bangladesh’s seamers are adopting a death strategy, a long way from home.  It is great to see England playing Bangladesh but it highlights the shocking lack of cricket between the two teams in this country. Despite the huge Bangladeshi population in the UK, the ECB has not held a bilateral fixture with Bangladesh in England since 2010, in any form of cricket. It really is a disgrace and if the ECB is serious about its drive for equality, then playing fixtures against Bangladesh, opening the grounds to that community, is surely a sensible step.  But how many fixtures do Bangladesh have in England until the end of the next future tours programme in 2028? None. Root becomes the third Yorkshire player if not Yorkshireman to breach fifty by pulling Shoriful for four then whips a single through square leg.  Malan is beaten all ends up by a yorker, but so, no’ but just, are the stumps and then, as if to prove the perverse nature of the bowler’s lot, Malan chisels a straighter yorker away for four.   The British, in the days of the Raj, always felt happier and more relaxed up in the hills than down in the plains. Such were the parties and high life in Darjeeling and Simla – and this England innings is in a similar spirit, after their anxieties in Ahmedabad. As if he were practising for a dance this evening , Captain Root (or ex captain in cricket terms) is relishing the chance to parade his footwork.  That was Shakib bowling out in the previous over, I forgot to mention, finishing with 10-0-52-1.  Malan is now unchained and poor Mehidy pays the price. The left-hander slog sweeps in front of square for four and then smashes successive sixes. The first, a legside drag-down, is hammered over midwicket for six, followed by a steepling on drive after dropping to one knee for another. He sandwiches those two sixes with a final four off the over, using his feet to step into the legside and cream an inside-out drive through cover. Twenty-two off the over.   Malan is so consistent. He has made a hundred in all of his last six different ODI series, across six different countries: the Netherlands, Australia, South Africa, Bangladesh, England, and now India. He has a chance to make this. his first really big hundred, now.   The ICC fiendishly tried to scupper Malan by scheduling a drinks break when he was on 99 but it doesn’t work its usual sinister magic and he plays tip and run to cover to bring up his hundred. It’s his fourth ODI hundred of the year, came off 91 balls, and his sixth in only 23 matches, only a handful opening.  Malan earns a Flake by moving to 99 with a two driven to the cover boundary man to end a Mahedi over which had already yielded five singles as England adopt turbo-milking mode.  Not sure this is the right approach from Shakib to keep bowling himself. Yes, he needs a wicket desperately and yes, he is their best bowler but if he bowls out here, he is going to leave the rest of his misfiring attack hopelessly exposed, particularly given who’s coming in at four, five, six and seven. Anyway, here he is for his ninth over. England bide their time, taking him for three singles. he does pin Root who was trying to reverse sweep but the ball came off his glove and pitched outside leg anyway.  The modern hypothesis is that whatever you have at 30 overs should be doubled by 50. England will be aiming for a bit more, 400+ I reckon.  Mahedi replaces the Fiz and Malan smears a square cut for four as the off-spinner drags another one down. The fielder, No16, did dive but can’t reach it, grazing his elbow in the process. Three singles are easy pickings for England who are motoring nicely again.  Root is cooking and showing us his 360 degree game now, adjusting when Shakib, who has brought himself back, skids one through outside off to reverse sweep fine for four. After Root eases a drive down to long off for a single, Malan cuts for two then smacks a single off the back foot to deep mid-on, about 10 yards from the rope.  Shakib may be rueing his return as he doesn’t find the rhythm he has in his seven-over spell, dragging the next ball down and knitting his brow when Root collars a pull in front of square for four.  Root does indeed break free, without the Freddie Mercury ’tache/Bet Lynch mufti, with his impish scoop, risking dental disintegration but timing it perfectly to flick it over his left shoulder for six, using the angle of Mustafizur, the left-arm quick, coming round the wicket.   England suddenly look skittish as Bangladesh apply the squeeze of the dot-ball vice. The ball is softer and they are bowling straighter. Root can still pick off singles but Malan needs to hit the ball harder and, when he tries to break free with an expansive cover drive off Mehidy, Towhid risks a dive on this outfield and claws it back, keeping him down to two. He’s OK, too, sliding on his chest rather than hazarding a knee-slide.  Middle-order control is gradually being exerted by Bangladesh. Malan tries to break the stranglehold with a heave across the line that brings him only a single. Root cannot pierce cover point or short extra off the following slower ball and only adds one more to the total with a bottom-edged pull to midwicket.  So, Shakib is keeping three overs up his sleeve. He brings back Mehidy and he rewards his captain with a tight over. largely of darts, costing merely four singles.  There’s still more empty seats then we would like but a decent atmosphere in Dharamsala considering this is a day game on a Tuesday, with the crowd boosted by free tickets to school children.  Root, now Mustafizur has recovered, tries to close the face on a legside flick but does not do so in time and the ball sails over mid-on off a leading edge for a single. Malan eases a drive to mid-on for a single and Root ends the over with a sweetly timed square drive that earns him only a single.  And Mustafizur is passed fit to continue. A wee limp as he practises his action but otherwise OK.   Root pulls away very late, forcing Mustafizur to abort in his delivery stride and he seems to have hyper-extended his knee as he stopped in the nick of time. The ankle buckled first. Looks painful and possibly serious.  Shakib just keeps rolling along and England play him cautiously, Malan whipping a single to the square leg sweeper and driving two to the cover boundary rider. Root milks a single down to long off. Shakib has 7-0-31-1. The Fiz has been going for 7 an over, Taskin 5.33, Shoriful and Mehidy 7.66, Mahedi 9.5.  Mehidy returns and Root strides on to the danceloor, taking two steps down to loft a drive over the offie’s head for four. But his neck is saved next ball when the ball sticks in the pitch and Root tried to punch it off the back foot and spooned it maybe 2ft abover the bowler’s grasp as he pogoed to try to reach it. It’s a batsman’s game part 2,456,245.  Shakib wisely stays on for a sixth over in succession but as by far the best bowler, head and shoulders above his team-mates, how long can the captain go on for? He blows his top when Malan cuts through point for four. Tanzib misfields and tene, because of the treacherous outfield, cannot redeem himself with a committed dive.  Taksin returns for the new batsman and starts with a couple of dot balls. Root has happy feet, busily defending, looking for a misfield but only gets going with a midwicket flick for two and a gloved pull for one. Malan, though, finds the middle of the bat, mowing Taksin over midwicket for four from the kind of delivery most batsmen of the past would have tried to hit through point.  Excellent from Shakib to use his variations, a big turning stock ball that ragged square, a skidder and then the arm ball to complete the three card trick.  Root gets off the mark first ball with a tap through cover.  Bairstow b Shakib 52  Loses his leg stump as he stepped back to try to work it through midwicket. Qucik arm ball that did bounce higher than most of his previous deliveries.  FOW 115/1 Shoriful returns and Malan piles into the left-arm quick, carting him from outside off over deep backward square for four and then, next ball, inflicts the psychological torture of a deliberate edge, opening the face to glide it wide of the keeper. It’s the kind of shot that makes batsmen smirk and bowlers contemplate murder.  Malan raises the century for England with a tight single shovelled through midwicket but Bairstow gives Shakib hope when he tries to cut off middle and leg. He does hit it but had it skidded through instead of sat up, he would have been a goner. He plays the last ball of the over upright and with a flick for two that brings up his fifty, senior partner style off 54 balls, his 15th ODI fifty, shaded only by his 11 hundreds.   Dawid Malan’s partnership with Jonny Bairstow is very different to Jason Roy’s with Bairstow. There’s no really natural chest-out bully in this one, and the singles don’t flow so naturally. But there is no reason this one cannot be really effective, too. After this excellent start, they can just tick over because the ball is not turning.  Mahedi replaces Mehidy and Bairstow greets his return rudely by scything his drag-down for four then slapping his low full toss over square leg for another. Another short one is filleted through point for one and Bairstow moves closer to 50. The full toss slipped out of his hand as he went for the slider.  Time for drinks.  After some talk about Dawid Malan starting a little slower than Jason Roy he’s played exquisitely this morning to reach a 39-ball 50. Within the first seven overs he twice hit Mustafizur over the short square boundaries - the first a flick, the second a hook. After the hooked six Mustafizur overcorrected: Malan crunched a full toss down the ground for another four. He’s also been aggressive against spin, reverse sweeping Shakib for a boundary. On a fine batting track, England might have have designs on reaching the 386 they hit against Bangladesh in the 2019 World Cup. The outfield has held up OK, barring a minor scare when Shanto misfielded at point and a small piece of turf came up when his knee landed on the outfield. Fielders seem to be a little more cautious than normal but the outfield has so far been less of a talking point than feared. The first extra of the innings is added when Shakib fires one past Malan’s leg stump. Malan takes a single with a cut, Bairstow works covers legs for another and then Malan brings up a 39-ball fifty by slipping a single fine off his pads.  Bairstow is pinned while sweeping, Shakib having given it a touch more air as it curved in. But it was sliding down.  The spinners are leaking boundaries. Mehidy errs too short and Bairstow flays him through cover for four and, though his field keeps England down to just two singles off the final four deliveries, the openers are rattling along.  Just the start England needed after the timid, tentative approach in the opening match. Spin will be the challenge, rather than the ball coming on to the bat from the seamers. Bairstow is having to step up in the absence of Roy and play as the senior partner, even though Malan is older. In the past, he has sometimes struggled with more responsibility.  Remember how Bairstow looked uncomfortable with the tail in Test cricket when batting down the order. Roy was a great foil for Bairstow, and very good at cajoling the best out of a complex player to produce England’s best ODI opening partnership. Malan is different, a bit more like Bairstow in how he can fret over his place and become wrapped up in his own game.Both are fine players with different strengths, and it will be fascinating to see how they develop in this tournament. They could be a natural fit. Bairstow drills a cover drive for a single and Malan reverses the hands to sweep Shakib past short third man for four. Malan works a single through midwicket, Bairstow carves one down to long off and Malan ends the over farming the strike with another wristy push through mid-on.  Malan uses his feet to dance down and whisk Mehidy for four through midwicket then, after three dot balls arcing onto him from round the wicket, he gorges on a wider one, opens the face and laces it behind point for four more. That was a very deft piece of wrist work. Shot! Shakib brings himself on, left-arm spin round the wicket to Bairstow and he re-establishes some control with a lower trajectory than the offie. England take a single apiece off his skidders. None of the startling bounce that earned him a three-for against Afghanistan in that over.  Mahedi, who replaced Mahmadullah in the XI, is coming on for an over of Powerplay spin. He’s an off-spinner and comes round the wicket to Malan who caresses a drive down to long off for the single that brings up England’s fifty. His first ball to Bairstow is too short and, though it skids on, Bairstow takes a step back and hammers it through cover for four with his bat at five o’clock. Malan doesn’t get hold of an off drive having come down the pitch  but he bullies it past the bowler for four anyway.  Lisa Sthalekar points out that the overthrow in the previous over came because Mushfiqur thought Bairstow was dawdling and not grounding his bat – shades of Lord’s.  Bairstow pulls out of  his stance with Shoriful halfway to the crease because the DJ/PA has kept the inter-over sting pumping at high volume. With the swing now evaporating, Bairstow clatters a square drive for four then, by pinching a single to leg gully and doubling his return when Mushfiqur’s throw cannons off the stumps and makes a gift of a buzzer.  The Fiz continues for a fourth over and, after the openers exchange singles, Malan streakily off the top edge on the pull, the ball sailing 3ft over a leaping midwicket, the tall left-hander threshes a pull off his midriff from outside off over fine leg for six! Having gone short, Mustafizur overcompensates and pitche sit up, right in Malan’s slot and he drills it past the bowler for four! After his fielding aberration in the last over, Shoriful is given the ball. The tall left-armer pins Bairstow first ball with one that was just pitched outside leg. Attractive swing, though, and right on the money. Bangladesh fancy sneaking one through Bairstow’s gate and he gives them some encouragement by whipping one off middle through square leg for a single. A wee bit more tail in and he would have been in trouble. Malan earns one off the inside edge as he pushes around his pad and Bairstow ends the over thumping four down the ground.  Good start from Bangladesh, who have made life hard for England. It’s easy to think of them as a spin-bowling team, and they will be fierce later. But they have some very handy seamers. On the tour there earlier this year, I really liked Hasan Mahmud, who only makes the bench today, but will succeed Taskin at some stage, I reckon.   Fantastic decision from Ahsan Raza and their doubts have cost Bangladesh a review. Malan, having been done for pace but survived, has never felt more alive and two balls later lamps a cover drive for four through a poor dive from Shoriful followed by a towering six, slog swept into the second tier. It made a lovely sound off the bat, that one.  It hit his left shoulder as he missed with his pull.  Malan c Mushfiqur b Mustafizur  Did he hit it? There was a noise.  Taskin drops one short outside off and Bairstow is on to it in a flash, pulling it hard for four. The right-arm quick pushes his length up and tempts Bairstow into a flashing cut that he misses as it nips back in, losing his bottom-hand grip as he tried to fetch and clobber it. Two balls later is an exact duplicate right down to the one-handed swipe. Bangladesh know he does drag on now and again and are feeding that option. Twice he connects with the stroke, twice extra-cover stops a run.  Bangladesh put in a leg gully for Bairstow, looking for a legside flick, or, rather, a lazy legside flick. Bairstow does make him work to stop a single and then has a big swish at the one the left-arm quick. Mustafizur, pushes across him. But the stock ball with this field targets the pads and Bairstow scuffs it off the inside edge square of that leg gully for a single. Malan blocks out the next ball then has a big swing and a miss at the last ball of a probing over. He looks dangerous while it’s swinging and Malan is always going to drive on length.  Taskin take the other new ball, overpitches, straining for swing and Bairstow creams the half-volley for four through extra-cover. That’s enough of that ... he takes out the slip, pulls his length back and Bairstow misses out on the square cut, under-edging it into the ground and Mushfiqur stops the run. Definitely swing but straight from the hand and thus easy to counter. No chance for him to diddle a batsman with it without a slip too.  Bairstow’s cross-bat chop earns him one as it bursts through points hands on the bounce but Malan is not so fortunate at beating the infield.  This is the quickest pitch at the World Cup and Mustafizur decides to start with a short one that lifts towards his sternum and he blocks it back down the pitch. The next ball is fuller and YJB plays tip and run into the offside for a single.  The left-handed Malan is beaten by a ripper that shapes away from the edge and seems to keep a little low, passing the O in the TON on the maker’s name. Whoops! he does it again next ball, too. The left-arm quick is swinging it.  But Malan, having groped at two, eases ‘the Fiz’ through cover for four and it’s noticeable that the chasing fielder doesn’t try to dive to claw it back, though he would have done and would have been successful elsewhere.   This is a day game and about as north as you can play international cricket in India, so dew will not be a issue. Mustafizur takes the first over.  Of the electrical variety ... and they have had to put even more sand on the outfield this morning. Its shoddy state is the result of a fungal infection, says Michael Atherton.  But it seems to be working now, just before the national anthems.  Greetings from Dharamsala, where the dramatic overnight thunder and lightning has given way to a lovely morning. The pitch looks excellent for batting, so England will aim to score 300 after being inserted - Bangladesh will hope to exploit any early moisture in the wicket. Jonny Bairstow is playing his 100th cap; Eoin Morgan made the presentation before returning to his commentary duties. As expected the only England change is Reece Topley for Moeen Ali, which gives England four seamers: a better balance generally, and certainly at one of the most pace-friendly grounds in the competition. Now lets see how the outfield holds up.  Bangladesh Litton Das, Tanzid Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Towhid Hridoy, Mahedi Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Mustafizur Rahman. England Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (capt & wk), Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley.   Reece Topley replaces Moeen Ali for England, Mahmudullah is out for Bangladesh and is replaced by Mahedi Hasan.  And put England in to bat. Ho, hum. That’s two in succession Buttler has lost.  It would be rash and hysterical to conclude after England’s opening defeat by New Zealand in Ahmedabad that the world champions’ bid to win a second successive World Cup is in crisis. There were plenty of mitigating issues, not least the absence of Ben Stokes and the lack of authentic match preparation in India. That has long been the players’ preference and they have tended to go into every series, home and away in all formats recently, positively undercooked. Remember how shaky they were in their first innings against New Zealand in 2022 in Stokes’ first match as long-term Test captain, or again against South Africa at Lord’s following a white-ball break or against Ireland in the World T20 or, indeed, at Edgbaston and Lord’s in the Ashes.  They usually find a way to come good and today, even on the decidedly dodgy Dharamsala outfield, they have the perfect opportunity to get their bandwagon rolling. And yet, although England beat Bangladesh in last March’s ODI series, Shakib Al Hasan’s side were well worth their victory over India at the Asia Cup last month and he and the off-spinner Mehidy rattled through Afghanistan in their opening match on this ground. If the pitch allows turn again, they would pose far more problems for England’s hitters than Messrs Santner, Ravindra and Phillips who lured five batsmen, all of who had played themselves in, to their doom on Wednesday. Any repeat of that tentativeness, in going for expansive shots but without fully committing, messing up their timing with uncharacteristic confusion, and they will come another cropper. The problem with the batting – leaving at least 60 runs out there – was nothing compared with the pat-a-cake quality of their bowling. The lack of swing rendered Sam Curran after his opening spell and Chris Woakes throughout eminently tonkable. Mark Wood looked rusty and lacked rhythm, the spinners had no scoreboard pressure to bolster their defences and the dew affected their grip and rip. But let us not forget that the best figures recorded on an ODI at this Himalayan idyll were Suranga Lakmal’s four for 13 in 2017, when he reduced India to 28 for six, and Tim Bresnan’s four for 45 10 years ago.

Bangladesh hospitals at breaking point as dengue crisis intensifies,6 Sep 2023 • 8:09 pm,"Hospital corridors are overflowing with dengue patients in Bangladesh, as wards run out of beds in a record-breaking outbreak that is pushing the nation’s health system to the limit.  While the south Asian country has been battling a surge of infections since April, the epidemic has recently intensified. More than 340 of the 650 dengue fatalities so far this year were reported in August – making it the deadliest month in history.  A “huge” influx of patients has also put significant pressure on the health system, a World Health Organization (WHO) situation report warned this week.  Since January, 133,134 people have tested positive for dengue in Bangladesh’s hospitals, including around 70,000 last month, according to government figures. On August 12 alone, close to 10,000 people were hospitalised.  “A lot of patients are sleeping on the floor, there are too many patients and too few beds,” Prof Kabirul Bashar, a medical entomologist at Jahangirnagar University who has spent time at one of the capital city’s biggest public hospitals, told the Telegraph. “It is a similar situation across Dhaka … we are in a very difficult moment.” Dr Mohammad Shafiul Alam,  a scientist in the infectious diseases unit at a health research centre in Dhaka called icddr,b, added that “everyone knows someone who has caught dengue”. Official figures, he said, do not give a true indication of the size of the outbreak, as they only include people who have gone to hospital.  “It is definitely an underestimate. Cases are at least 10 times higher than the official reports,” Dr Alam told the Telegraph. “People are worried.” Bangladesh has seen fairly regular outbreaks of dengue – dubbed ‘break-bone fever’ because severe joint pain can be one of the symptoms – for more than two decades.  Yet this year has been “unusual,” according to the WHO. Not only did a surge in cases start early, but it has spread beyond cities to every district in Bangladesh. And at 0.48 per cent, the case fatality rate is significantly higher than the average of 0.29 per cent seen over the previous five years.  Dr Alam said epidemics usually coincide with the rainy season, which – combined with high humidity and temperatures – offers ideal conditions for the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to breed. This year the rains came early, and so did dengue.  He added that the virus has also become endemic across the country because creeping urbanisation has created more habitats for the mosquitoes to thrive outside cities like Dhaka.  Yet, for the most part, patients are still directed to major cities for care. This has put huge strain on hospitals, especially in Dhaka, where health authorities have repurposed Covid facilities for dengue. But it also helps explain the high fatality rate: it is taking too long for patients to get the care they need.  “The problem is that people are coming into hospital too late, when their condition is already severe,” said Dr Alam. “The clinicians say that in some cases this is because cases deteriorated very quickly, and in others because they have travelled from very far away.” The outbreak is also significantly disrupting care for other conditions, added Dr Bashar.  “Hospital beds are limited, doctors are limited, nurses are limited. If there is a high number of dengue patients, it affects the management and resources of the whole hospital,” he said. “This has had a great impact across the entire health system.” Bangladesh is not the only country struggling to contain dengue this year. The virus is surging from Sri Lanka to Peru, with the WHO warning last month that the situation could surpass 2019 – the worst on record for worldwide cases. Dengue has been a mounting threat for decades. In the 1970s, it was endemic in just nine countries. Now, spurred on by urbanisation, international travel and climate change, it is found in more than 100.  It is likely that number will rise further in the years to come. Shifts in temperatures mean dengue-spreading mosquitoes are increasingly encroaching into new areas, including Europe. Last week, health authorities fumigated parts of Paris for the first time, in an attempt to kill mosquitoes amid concerns dengue could spread.  In Bangladesh, experts warned that the government needs to do more to control the mosquitoes and prevent large outbreaks happening in the first place.  “We need to make an integrated mosquito management plan for Bangladesh, and to enact it year round,” said Dr Bashar. This should include innovations such as Wolbachia – where mosquitoes are infected with a natural bacteria that prevents them spreading dengue – as well as spraying insecticides and reducing the availability of breeding sites.  “Dengue is staying here for a long time, so we need to do long term planning,” added Dr Alam. “Vector control is the main thing, but we also need to think about vaccines as soon as possible.” Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security"
"As extreme heat and wildfires hit Europe, experts look to Bangladesh for climate change advice",18 Jul 2023 • 6:07 pm,"It was the middle of the night when Cyclone Bhola unexpectedly struck Abdul Jalil Mirdha’s village in 1970, in a flash destroying many of the wooden shack houses and killing dozens of his neighbours. The then 12-year-old’s parents tied him and his siblings to a pillar inside to prevent them from washing away as several feet of water poured into their home and a wall collapsed. They clung on until the next day, but not everyone was so lucky. “In the morning, there were many bodies floating around,” says Mirdha, now 65, standing beside an estuary in Bangladesh’s southern Barishal district. “People were crying. Cattle were dead. You cannot imagine the suffering.” Cyclone Bhola, a Category 3 cyclonic storm that had winds of up to 150 mph, remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded and one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters in history, killing up to half a million people across the Bay of Bengal. Super cyclones are becoming more frequent due to climate change (they have increased fivefold since 1970) but Bangladesh has learnt to deal with them in a way that other countries – including many in Europe – have not. Despite its low-lying subtropical terrain, the death toll in Bangladesh from disasters has fallen to less than 1 per cent of what it was thanks to a world-leading defence system. The South Asian nation’s progress in dealing with disasters is in stark contrast with the situation in Europe, which in recent years has seen 180 Germans killed by flash floods, numerous deaths due to unprecedented wildfires in France, Spain and Greece, and an historic heatwave that killed more than 61,000 people across the continent.  European authorities are now scrambling to put disaster defence systems in place – and they are looking to Bangladesh for advice. “Many countries are trying to learn lessons from the success of Bangladesh,” says Dr Bayes Ahmed, associate professor in risk and disaster science at University College London. “It has proven to be a world class example.” The latest evidence of Bangladesh’s success came on May 14 when Cyclone Mocha, one of the strongest to make landfall this century, struck southeast Bangladesh and southwest Myanmar with winds of up to 160 mph.  Hundreds are said to have died in Myanmar, but in Bangladesh, despite the fact 2.3 million people were exposed to the Category 5 cyclone and 13,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, there were not any reported deaths. “We saw it coming early,” says Ahmadul Haque, director of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief’s Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP). “That allowed us to take the necessary action ahead of time.” The government began pre-cyclone monitoring in late April, according to Mr Haque. By May 4, communities began to receive warnings. As the depression formed on May 9, still 1,000 miles off the coast, the Meteorological Department declared a cyclone. A red alert was signalled on the night of May 12, two days before Mocha struck, and 750,000 people were evacuated into cyclone shelters and makeshift facilities.  “We have a very good early action protocol,” adds Mr Haque. “There are 71 predetermined actions that combine proper anticipation, timely response and community support.” If Bangladesh’s defences had not been in place, a cyclone like Mocha “could have killed millions,” according to Dr Ahmed, particularly given its high population density. With the support of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, the government launched its highly-effective early warning system in the aftermath of Cyclone Bhola in 1972, investing in weather forecasting technology, nationwide communication networks, cyclone shelters, and mass training for frontline, community-based volunteers. The shift was from reactive relief-based measures to a proactive system of using four fundamental pillars: preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. “Over those years we have developed by far the best cyclone warning and evacuation system in the world,” says Prof Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, a research institute based in Dhaka. Before efforts began, Bangladesh had only three coastal radars, capable of tracking cyclones 200 miles from the coast. Now it has 256 local weather stations paired with data from the World Meteorological Organization’s 193 member states to help detect and monitor incoming storms.  When necessary, warnings are disseminated through TV and radio broadcasts, SMS notifications, and a 24-hour helpline. But crucially, to reach the most remote and vulnerable, an army of more than 76,000 local volunteers take to coastal villages with megaphones and sirens, raise warning flags in key public areas, and even go door-to-door for the most isolated homes. Evacuees are taken to Bangladesh’s 15,000 cyclone shelters – up from the 44 that existed in 1970. As soon as Mirdha turned 18, back in 1976, he became a volunteer. Now he is a unit team leader in Barishal as well as a farmer. “That’s why I started doing this: to save people,” he says. “Many died because we weren’t prepared or aware of the risk.” Between them, community volunteers are tasked with disseminating initial warnings, accompanying villagers to the nearest shelter, rescuing those in need, providing first aid, and distributing emergency supplies like dry foods during and after the cyclone.  Abdul Hossen, a 33-year-old farmer working with Mirdha, helped carry three elderly people out of their homes when Cyclone Citrun, the last major storm in their area (it avoided Mocha), hit in November 2022. “God will help me if I help others,” he says. Bangladesh’s world-leading disaster management could provide important lessons. Last year, 387 natural hazards and disasters were recorded worldwide, resulting in 30,704 deaths and affecting 185 million people, according to the Emergency Event Database.  Hurricane Ian killed 130 people in the US, floods in Pakistan led to 1,739 deaths, an earthquake in Afghanistan resulted in 1,036 fatalities, and Tropical Storm Megi caused the loss of 346 lives in the Philippines. The UN projects that if no action is taken, there will be 560 medium- or large-scale disasters a year by 2030. “It’s a very serious challenge,” says Prof Huq. “Even for rich countries like the US, when you think about disasters like Hurricane Katrina. We are very happy to share our learnings and knowledge. We know how to protect lives.” At the UN Climate Change Conference in November 2022, the UN Secretary General António Guterres set out a plan to protect “everyone on Earth” with an early warning system by 2027. The World Meteorological Organization says nearly half the world’s nations do not have an early warning system. A report by the Global Commission on Adaptation estimated spending $800 million on such systems in developing countries would avoid losses of up to $16 billion a year. Yet as Italian health officials warned of a brutal heatwave expected to reach 48C this week and Spain battles with a wildfire on the Canary island of La Palma that has burned 4,600 hectares of land, there are fresh concerns Europe, the fastest-warming continent, is underprepared for climate disaster – just as Bangladesh was in the 1970s. The consequences will be deadly and costly. Some 68,000 Europeans will be killed by extreme heat each summer by 2030 if more effective adaptation plans are not implemented, according to research published last week by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. The European Environment Agency estimates disasters caused €13 billion in economic losses a year from 1980 to 2021, with the cost set to rise. “Early warnings and anticipatory action of extreme weather events associated with this major climate phenomenon are vital to save lives and livelihoods,” says Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, a UN body. Thankfully, some progress has been made in future-proofing the continent. In April, the UK tested a system for broadcasting emergency messages about extreme weather for the first time. In May, the Greek capital Athens announced its new chief heat officer, an innovative role aimed at boosting the city’s defences against deadly heat. Other cities such as Paris, Milan and Rotterdam have rolled out an extreme heat app. But experts warn more is needed to prepare Europe for the looming climate-related disasters. Bangladesh, which is now developing warning systems for earthquakes, landslides, fires and flash floods, has shown what difference a smart, sophisticated alert system can make, according to Tamanna Rahman, lead for the international nonprofit Practical Action’s Flood Resilience project in Bangladesh. “This model has been proven to save lives,” says Ms Rahman. “Now we need to properly invest in it.” Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security"
Bangladesh sweep butter-fingered England aside,14 Mar 2023 • 10:03 pm,"By Will Macpherson in Dhaka England added dismal fielding to their already listless batting and were condemned to a 3-0 T20 whitewash by Bangladesh, with coach Matthew Mott bemoaning their worst performance of the tour. The trip began brightly, with an excellent ODI series win in conditions that were so extreme Mott believes they will act as “over-training” for the World Cup in India later this year. But England lost their last four games with the last, a 16-run defeat, the most frustrating for the England coach. Not even Jos Buttler’s first toss win in nine matches this year could change England’s fortunes. They had the advantage of bowling first, but threw it away with a poor fielding performance. Rehan Ahmed and Ben Duckett dropped simple catches off Jofra Archer, while at least three boundaries should have been prevented. It was only an excellent final five overs that cost just 27, led by Sam Curran, that kept Bangladesh to a total of 158, which Mott still considered 15 too many. “[The fielding was] incredibly disappointing,” said Mott. “Our first 15 overs in the field was nowhere near the level that we'd expect. There were not a lot of clean hands, some basic skill errors and that is not something we’re accustomed to seeing. “It also should act as a real eye-opener on where we need to improve. I think Bangladesh definitely outfielded us in most of the games but particularly today. “That one hurts today. We turned up trying to square the ledger at three and three. We're really proud of our one-day win, that's a massive effort, and we came over here to do well but to finish the way we did will leave a sour taste in our mouths.” England’s short batting line-up suffered from the same issues it has in the first two games: wickets lost in clusters, and a lack of power at the death. Phil Salt’s miserable trip continued, as he fell for a first-ball duck. Of his six dismissals on tour, five have been to four different left-arm spinners. This time, he found a new mode of dismissal, stumped, losing his balance to debutant Tanvir Islam. That brought Dawid Malan, who rode his luck, and Buttler together, and they forged a strong position. As they did in the first game of the series, England wasted it with two wickets in two balls. Malan was caught behind off Mustafizur Rahman, then Buttler was run out. Ben Duckett called him through for a questionable single, but the flat-footed skipper was too lax to beat Mehidy Hasan Miraz’s fantastic throw.   “Losing two wickets in two balls is really poor, I’m very disappointed in myself for not diving, that potentially cost us the game,” said Buttler. From there, England slid inevitably to defeat, losing five wickets for 28. Make no mistake, these are tough batting conditions, and England are missing players for all sorts of reasons. Some are rested, others injured, while there is a group who have chosen to play in the Pakistan Super League, with its greater financial rewards. The frustration is that England did not improve the more they were exposed to the conditions. Asked whether he regretted not replacing Tom Abell and Will Jacks after they were injured, Mott said: “If you look at how many players we've exposed this year alone, we've gone a fair way down the depth charts. The realisation that we're probably better off investing in some batters that we can put under pressure in these games. “You only learn from your mistakes and I think the opportunities that they've been given here will give them to reflect. When we get into pressure situations in World Cups, I'm confident that it was the right decision. “It would have been a really tough ask to bring someone in at really short notice to play that role in the middle order. “One thing we are really mindful of is that we have a lot of top-order batting options, but what we have to continue to improve is that middle order, all-rounders, and their capacity to win games for us. We saw that as an opportunity here, in hindsight people might question that but we were confident with the discussions we had that it was the right call.” It's really disappointing to lose but congrats to Bangladesh, they outplayed us and deserve their victory. We came back well, after missing some opportunities in the field. The wicket played better and it was a good score to restrict them to. Losing two wickets in two balls is really poor, very disappointed in myself for not diving. It potentially cost us the game. Proclaims the host of the presentations. What a feast day for Mr White Detergent! Bangladesh sweep the world champions. England had bowled with miserly poise at the death but Bangladesh did even better, nit simply stemming the runs but taking wickets. Two in successive deliveries, removing the well-set Malan and Buttler essentially ended it and this was no pitch for a new batsman to come in on and immediately have to swing for the rope.  Have England learned anything from this tour? Not much more than Archer is back. And in some ways, that's enough. Bangladesh were terrific, batting with real style and bowling with precision and guile, out-batting, out-bowling and out-fielding England.  Woakes spanks the first ball, one-handed, over mid-off for four, a yard short of going for six. Hasan had tried the yorker but didn't land it.  The next delivery is a yorker too and Woakes opens the face to squirt it behind point for four more. Nineteen needed off four.  Bowling coach Allan Donald comes to the rope to give some advice and Hasan responds with a slow ball. Woakes swings and misses and they hare through for a bye. England need three sixes. Jordan swings and misses at the next, another slower ball and they run a bye after Jordan swings hard and misses. A hat-trick of slower balls keep Woakes thrashing at fresh air. And he pins him on the pad with the last ball. Bangladesh win by 16 runs.  Curran departs but England can't get under Shakib's skiddy darts. They take him for merely four singles to leave them with mission impossible on this pitch - 27 off six.  Curran c Tanvir b Shakib 4 Looking to go long over cow corner it takes the leading edge and spoons up to cover.  FOW 128/6 Mustafizur applies the vice with a tight line and reverse swing, pace on and pace off, bamboozling Woakes with the latter. England can't find the middle of their bats nor the gaps and take only five off the over. Mustafizur wraps up with 4-0-14-1. England need 31 off 12. Curran works his first ball from Taskin for a single. The right-arm quick is still swinging it. Duckett squeezes a single down to third man, Curran walks down to tap a single through mid-on, Taskin having followed his step away to leg to try to free his hands. A slow bouncer that trampolines over Duckett is called wide so England will have another go ... In fact Taskin has another go and sends off-stump cartwheeling.  Taskin finishes with 4-0-26-2. England need 36 off 18.  Duckett b Taskin 12  Stepped away to try to find a gap but the slower ball reverses in and castles him.  FOW 123/5  Moeen c Mehidy b Taskin 9  Full pace bouncer, angling in to the left-hander. Moeen takes it on but can't get a full swing at it and cloths it down the midwicket sweeper's throat.  FOW 119/4  Hasan Mahmud starts with two dot balls, slow and across Moeen. England's vice captain, after two swings and misses, connects with the third and dumps it over long on for six. He bunts a single past the bowler then Duckett plays a full front pull all along the carpet for four. Hasan finishes with a fine yorker that Duckett can't work past a fielder.  An over of madness for England, then, and this looks a serious task now. Mehidy makes things happen, to borrow a cliche.   Mehidy comes straight back and diddles Duckett with one that spat up at him and hit the glove. Das, fortunately for England, drops the catch. Duckett works a single off his pads, Moeen pushes another to extra cover and Duckett reverse scoops for four.  Mustafizur drags Bangladesh right back into this and with all their left-handers to come plus three overs left from their nemesis Mehidy. England need 57 off 36.  Buttler run out 40  Buttler had started to look frustrated at Malan's inability to turn long singles into tight but gettable twos. I think that's why he set off to steal a single when Duckett nudged his first ball to point. Great throw from Mehidy, knocking the coconut off the pole, and the England captain off his perch by a yard.  FOW 100/3 Malan c Das b Mustafizur 53  Shakib brings back his fastest bowler and he bangs one into the left-hander from over the wicket. Malan goes for the short-arm pull  but top-edges it and the keeper takes a fine catch, hands pointing skywards at the apex of his leap.  FOW 100/2 England take Shakib for five singles off his first five balls to bring up their hundred, all off the back foot as the Bangladesh captain tries to slide darts through their defence with his skiddy trajectory. England need 59 off 42 balls.   Bangladesh have been trying to preserve Mehidy's overs for England's legion of left-handers. But they can't wait any longer and Buttler launches a frontal assault, flaying the first back over the bowler's head for four, all bottom hand, so much so he sliced it and the ball boomeranged from mid-on to mid-off. Next ball Buttler's front leg retreats to leg and he frees his arms to murder an off-break over mid-off for six.  Malan brings up his fifty, a 16th in T20Is, for the former world No1, with a push to cover. It came off 43 balls.  Buttler wheels into a pull and smacks it so hard that the square leg fielder, who had only a couple of yards to make, couldn't stop it rattling past for four. Buttler steals a quick single by virtue of a headlong dive which leaves his chest and gloves covered with the light mud of dust and dew. Taskin tries to fool Malan with a slower bouncer but he has time to adjust, like a stuttering penalty taker such as Jorginho in his run-up. He completes half the semi-circle, waits then collars the pull for four.  Mustafizur slams on the brakes, or rather keeps his foot down on them, his pace and bounce and judicious use of the slower ball keep England down to three singles as they get tied up particular by the bounce. Hard to free your arms to balls arrowing into your body above the waist.  Time for drinks.  Mahmud changes ends and it almost bears fruit when Malan slaps a drive uppishly through the covers. Towhid dives to his left but can't close his fingers around it to complete the catch. Five singles off the over. The pitch deteriorated here swiftly in the first Tw0 but seems to be holding up pretty well so far.  Here comes the Fiz. Malan is given the hurry up by the left-arm quick for three balls, one of which beat the edge as he fenced after it. Mustafizur then strays wide and Malan rifles a cut for four. It's the only scoring stroke of the over, though, as Mustafizur returns to an off stump line and racks up his fourth and fifth dot balls.  Plenty of bounce for an old pitch, certainly enough to surprise Malan and smack him painfully on the hip. After a pair of singles, Malan laces a cut off Shakib for four followed by a mow over long on. Shanto backpedals, leaps, throws up his right arm and tips it over the rope for six.   Steady start for England, after the loss of Salt. 47-1 in the powerplay is decent. The trouble is that the powerplay hasn't been the problem, it's what follows.. Mahmud, a right-arm fast medium skidder, comes on. Malan leg glances the first ball for four with Swiss precision but he cannot beat the field or indeed the non-striker's stumps off the next four deliveries, only getting going again with a controlled pull behind square for a single. That's the end of the Powerplay.   Shakib starts with a dart on leg-stump and Buttler plays a remarkable shot all blacksmith forearm power to clump the ball through midwicket for four. After a couple of singles nudged into the gaps, Buttler wants to go big again but this time Shakib had come round the wicket and the ball gripped and turned. Buttler, aiming for cover or mid-off, nicks it high over slip for a single.  Buttler wiggles his left shoulder, whisks two off his pads then climbs into Taskin and plants him back over his head for four. After England scramble a leg-bye, Malan whirls into a pull and top-edges it wildly over third man for four. This ball is sticking in the pitch when the seamers roll their fingers across the seam.  Despite Malan being on strike, Shakib keeps Tanvir on, hoping the left-armer gets an opportunity against Buttler. They take a single apiece at the start of the over. Malan eyes up the legside boundary, assesses the field, drops down into his guard and promptly slog sweeps Tanvir for six. Malan flicks a single through midwicket before Buttler clips a single off his toes but is stymied in his desire to turn it into two.  No swing for England but Taksin is hooping it and Malan, having been given a life by the third umpire, flicks at another inswinger, misses with the bat but this time earns four leg-byes fine. It's a very testing over from right over. Nice and tight with plenty of movement, varying the inswinger by pushing a couple across Malan.    The third umpire said that there was an inside edge but I'm not sure there was. It looked like it may have hit the pad twice, rolling from one ridge to the next, hence the two spikes. Seemed to be daylight between bat and ball. Bangladesh look understandably bemused.  Malan lbw b Taskin  Looked out to me. Hit on the shins by the inswinger.  Bangladesh entrust new ball duties to the debutant Tanvir who starts with a low full toss that Malan whisks to the midwicket boundary for four with a twist of the wrists. Malan eases a drive for a single, putting Salt on strike. He has been troubled by left-arm spin all tour and falls first ball, Tanvir taking the pace off, tossing it up and turning it past Salt's edge as the opener groped forward and lost his balance.  Salt st Das b Tanvir 0 Out for a golden duck, toppling over as he tried to defend the debutant left-arm spinner. The ball turned away and Salt's travails against left-arm spin continue. FOW 5/1 Salt st Das b Tanvir So England did well to peg things back in the last five overs there, with Bangladesh only scoring 27 in that time. Sam Curran, in particular, was excellent, and they should be ruing their fielding in the early part of the innings, with two particularly dreadful dropped catches. England will still need a vastly improved batting display if they're to win the game. Bangladesh looked capable of 180 with five overs to go after a terrible fielding display from England, Jos Buttler's side rediscovered its death bowling mojo to restrict the hosts to 28 off the final five overs.  Shanto gets away with running right up the middle of the pitch when sent back. He ran back down it, too. Two singles start Curran's over before Shakib swings and misses at the bouncer. England review it but there was a big gap between glove and ball even at full speed. Shakib wants it called wide but it went past his eyebrows not above head height.. Curran is such a clever bowler, forcing Shakib to chisel out a yorker for only a single. Shanto thinks Curran will go for the slower ball but he doesn't and hence the batsman misses out on his scoop. The Surrey seamer ends the innings with another excellent yorker and finishes his day's work with the ball with 4-0-28-0.  Left-handers find it easier to skelp yorkers round the corner and Shanto does that for four. Jordan pins him next ball but DRS saves him after the umpire's finger shot up. Archer cuts off a thumping cut and saves two. Shanto wears a jarring delivery high on the bat and knocks it in front of square. They scramble two. Shakib ends the over walking across to scoop and is nutmegged by the ball, running a leg-bye off the inside of one of his knees to short third man.  Pitched quite a long way outside leg. Still, a dot ball.  Shanto lbw b Jordan  Out if it pitched in line.  Archer comes back from his final over, using his pace, applying it and taking it off, to keep the left-handers quiet for five balls. Shanto is struck in the chest and they burgle a leg-bye. Archer cantered up the pitch to try to complete the run-out with a side-foot shot at the the stumps but he sprays it wide.  Three good overs on the bounce from England.  Two excellent overs from England there, and Bangladesh have been pegged back. Rate is still above eight, but thy are not out of this yet. The silence when a wicket falls here is remarkable. Jordan starts with a full length ball that Shanto tries to throw everything but the kithcen sink at but plinks it off the toe for a single. Das jams out the yorker for a single and Jordan thwarts Shanto's attempt to scoop by following the left-hander as he walked over to the offside, cramping him. Jordan nails two more yorkers and concedes only a single, the second of them all but shaving off-stump. One ball to go and Jordan serves up the Sidebottom slow bouncer. Just as it did in 2010, it proves its worth. The batsmen can't resist but have to put all the power in themselves.   Das c Salt b Jordan 73  Jordan rounds off an excellent over with a slow bouncer that Das cloths to the midwicket sweeper.  FOW 139/2 Sam Curran returns and goes back to his World Cup tactics of painting the wide lines, hiding the ball outside off with the pace off. As such he forces the batsmen to stretch to play, messing with their timing. He gets out of the over for the price of merely three singles and a two. Canny effort.  Buttler calls Jordan back into the fray. Yorkers rather than slow bouncers hopefully.  Buttler decides to play the last Rashid over he usually keeps up his sleeve early. Shanto reverse sweeps for a single, Das chips the googly over cover for four then cuffs two through midwicket. Rashid takes the pace off, reduces the flight and gets out of the over with the damage of only two further singles.  Rashid ends with 4-0-23-1.  Archer breaks into a broad smile, with more than a hint of sarcasm, after Duckett crowns England's shabby display in the field by dropping Das at deep midwicket. Beaten for pace, Das had top-edged his pull but once again the ball burst through a pair of English hands. Das adds insult to injury by top edging a pull over third man for four, done for pace again, then picks the cutter and collars it, carting it over midwicket for six! Will Macpherson reports from Mirpur Jofra Archer has the right to be absolutely spewing. Ahmed, and now Duckett, have dropped shockers. After a delay for Das's concussion test, he brings up his fifty off Rehan's third over, clipping a single off his pads, nudging the googly round the corner. He exchanges singles with sweeps before Shanto ends the over by clearing the front leg and mowing the googly to cow corner for six.  Good start from Jordan with slower balls and a fine yorker. But Das refuses to be shackled, pulling the fourth ball through midwicket for four followed by another, with a lovely lofted drive the bat coming round the dial of the clock. Jordan takes the pace off and surprises Das at the end of the over, clonking him on the helmet as the batsman gets through his pull way too early.  Time for some off-spin. Moeen tosses one up, uncharacteristically, and Shanto skips down and lamps him over mid-off for six, the first of the innings. More poor fielding from England makes a gift of a two to Shanto for a legside flick who also adds two through point with a cut. He is batting with his usual pragmatism but Moeen almost winkles him out with a big off-break he was trying to work to leg. It takes a lading edge as he closes the face and drops safe.  Chris Jordan time. At least he will get one full over today after Sunday's five-ball kamikaze mission.  Long delay there, in the middle of an untidy over, I think because of some confusion over whether England could change the field for a wide following a free hit. Anyway, at the end of it, they didn't. England are bowling ok, but fielding horribly, which is not a winning combo. Sam Curran comes back and Das dabs him for four, using the angle across the right-hander from left-arm over to deflect it elegantly for four.  Curran oversteps and then delivers a high bouncer that is called wide for the free hit. He will have to bowl that again. Some debate about whether England can change the field – they should be able to because they took a single off the no-ball. So he is in within his rights. Shanto chisels out the yorker for a single when the free-hit finally comes.  Here's Jofra after Rehan's dropped catch: Time for drinks.  Rehan is bowling well with dip, grip and rip, twice beating Das. England's sub-standard fielding on tour comes back to bite them though when long-off allows a single to be doubled into two by dawdling and Rashid, inevitably after that glowing tribute, dives over a square cut at short backward point and lets it scuttle under him for four.  Rashid is still the go-to bowler for a crisis. To have watched his development since Eoin Morgan demanded his inclusion in the team has been to witness the flowering of an exceptional talent. Morgan deserves credit for many things but I genuinely believe Rashid has been his greatest success. Shows what encouragement and empowerment can achieve.     Talukdar caught and bowled Rashid 24 Toes a reverse sweep straight back to the bowler.  FOW 55/1 Rehan Ahmed comes on for a bowl and rips both a googly and a leg-break, the big turn preventing the batsmen scoring. Twice in the over he beats Das's bat but the Bangladesh keeper plays the long game, waits for the error then climbs into the drag-down to spank it through point for four off the back foot. Duckett chased and dived to try to claw it back but the ball carromed under his headlong slide.  Blimey! Rehan Ahmed grasses an absolute sitter. Talukdar went for a big swipe across the line and top-edged the ball to short third man. Rehan planted himself beneath the steepler and somehow let it burst between his hands. Archer's hands cover his eyes. A ball earlier he had more justified grounds for exasperation when Duckett saw the ball late at midwicket, chasing Talukdar's pull. He should have got there to save four but was on his heels. Archer takes his grievance out on the batsmen's bodies.  Good PowerPlay for Bangladesh. Opta have come up trumps so the scoreboard should be working now. Apologies for the delay. Das sweeps Rashid for four but both play out the rest of the over with the utmost caution, nurdling two singles and taking an extra for a wide after another googly slides down.  Apologies for the lack of a scoreboard, either in full or truncated form. Our statistics supplier does not have a deal for this particular T20 series. We're trying to sort something out.  Archer starts at a rapid lick and arrows a short ball into Talukdar, so close to the body that Rony flaps at it and only keeps it away from his solar plexus by wearing it on the hand. Talukdar gets down the other end, wisely, by shovelling a pull off his body. Das throws his hands at a back of a length ball at 91mph, exploiting the width to slap it up and over cover for four, Bangladesh get a life after a daft single when Salt's throw from point that would have left Talukdar stranded by two yards whistles past the stumps.  An early bowl for England's best, Adil Rashid. He starts with a quick googly that catches Das by surprise but he jams his bat down to keep it out. Das clips the slider away for a single. Talukdar works the leg-break through midwicket after a couple of wides when Rashid pitches his googly too far over to leg. Still, two singles and two extras represent a good over for England.   Here comes Jofra.  Chris Woakes shares new ball duties. Das walks across and tries to flip a decent length ball over long leg for six, kind of sweeping it. But it takes the leading edge and goes for a one-bounce four down to third man. Courage, Brother, do not stumble. Had he stumbled that could have been a case of dental, rather than mental disintegration. Das flicks to the midwicket sweeper then heaves across the line for a single squarer than the last. Rocking Rony ends the over charging Woakes and bludgeoning him back over his head for four. Hmm... No swing leaves Woakes horribly exposed.  And Curran starts with a legside wide. Das pushes the first legit delivery to point for an easy single. There are tufts of grass on this pitch, which was used for the first T20 when it turned sharply. Talukdar flips four off his toes behind square. A loose over so far from Curran. But after three balls he finds his line, arcing the ball back into the right-handed Das. earning a pair of dot balls. Make that three. Poor start but then Curran dragged it back.  And once he's stretched his groin, he will run in to bowl.  England Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (capt and wk), Dawid Malan, Ben Duckett, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, Rehan Ahmed,  Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer. Bangladesh make two changes: Tanvir Islam makes his debut and Shamim Hossain returns.  Rony Talukdar, Litton Das (wk), Najmul Hossain Shanto, Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Tanvir Islam, Taskin Ahmed,  Hasan Mahmud, Mustafizur Rahman. Jos Buttler has won the toss and has put Bangladesh in to bat. That's the first toss he's won in 2023, I think.  Good morning and welcome to live coverage of the third Twenty20 between Bangladesh and England from Dhaka. This winter England have played a T20 series in Pakistan, the World Cup in Australia, bilateral ODIs against Australia in Australia, a Test series in Pakistan, ODIs and T20s in South Africa, a Test series in New Zealand and ODIs and T20s in Bangladesh. I've been exhausted just covering it from London. Lord knows how the players must feel. Anyway, today they face the final curtain ... until the IPL starts The world champions find themselves 2-0 down, which is not exactly unexpected given all the mitigating factors. Having won the World Cup only five months ago, they are on a different cycle entirely, trying to prepare for their defence of the 50-over World Cup by experimenting with top-order places for their all-rounders, Sam Curran and Moeen Ali, while the attractions of franchise cricket, the recently completed Test series in New Zealand and the limited number of central contracts available mean that a lot of contenders for batting roles are otherwise occupied. While it would be hard to characterise this part of the tour as anything other than an encumbrance, there have been some successes, most of all the form of Jofra Archer that ought to put a smile on every fan of cricket and not just England supporters. The way he was used by Joe Root during the tour of New Zealand in 2019-20 as a kind of turbo Wagner, employing a thoroughbred to drag the rag and bone cart, almost destroyed this generational talent. But England's policy of wrapping him in cotton wool may yet make him a viable three-format bowler, used in Tests for impact rather than the entire series. As Archer contemplates a broad future, Moeen may well be slimming three in 2021 down to one. Moeen has already retired from Test cricket and, while the 50-over World Cup in India this autumn is a clear priority, the 35-year-old has floated the idea of subsequently stepping away from the format. ""I don't set a lot of goals, but I want to play that World Cup, be a part of that World Cup and hopefully win that World Cup and then we'll see,"" he told talkSPORT 2 ahead of Tuesday's series-ending T20 in Bangladesh. ""I'm not saying I will retire or I'm not saying I won't retire. Another seven or eight months at 35 is a lot. It could be a time where I'm thinking that's me done now and I might look at Livingstone and Jacksy and think 'you know what, my time is up, I'd rather these guys get ready for the next World Cup. ""I haven't decided but I have sort of an idea of what I want to try and do. It genuinely makes me really happy when I see players coming in - whatever's best for us and the side and going to make us champions, that's more important and that's the bigger picture really."" Expanding on the attraction of continuing as T20 specialist, Moeen added: ""I think it's something that's more logical and just makes more sense. If I'm playing well and playing all the franchise cricket - and playing for England - I don't see why not. ""Fifty overs does get harder the older you get, it's not easy to field and for sure it makes sense that I'll do that."" Rob Bagchi"
